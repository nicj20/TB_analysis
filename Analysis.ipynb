      "257, with absolute clarity. I feel as if I can reach out and trace them with a .\n",
      "130, fingertip. And yet, as clear as the scene may be, no one is in it. No .\n",
      "0, one. Naoko is not there, and neither am I. Where could we have .\n",

      "177, that seemed so important back then - Naoko, and the self I was then, .\n",
      "189, and the world I had then: where could they have all gone? It's true, I .\n",
      "0, can't even bring back her face - not straight away, at least. All I'm left .\n",
      "0, holding is a background, pure scenery, with no people at the front. .\n",
      "237, True, given time enough, I can remember her face. I start joining .\n",
      "338, images - her tiny, cold hand; her straight, black hair so smooth and .\n",
      "187, cool to the touch; a soft, rounded earlobe and the microscopic mole .\n",
      "0, just beneath it; the camel-hair coat she wore in the winter; her habit of .\n",
      "174, looking straight into my eyes when asking a question; the slight .\n",
      "0, trembling that would come to her voice now and then (as though she .\n",
      "0, were speaking on a windy hilltop) - and suddenly her face is there, .\n",
      "0, always in profile at first, because Naoko and I were always out .\n",
      "205, walking together, side by side. Then she turns to me and smiles, and .\n",
      "0, tilts her head just a little, and begins to speak, and she looks into my .\n",
      "0, eyes as if trying to catch the image of a minnow that has darted across .\n",
      "0, the pool of a limpid spring. .\n",
      "0, It takes time, though, for Naoko's face to appear. And as the years .\n",
      "140, have passed, the time has grown longer. The sad truth is that what I .\n",
      "0, could recall in 5 seconds all too soon needed 10, then 30, then a full .\n",
      "238, minute - like shadows lengthening at dusk. Someday, I suppose, the .\n",
      "0, shadows will be swallowed up in darkness. There is no way around it: .\n",
      "134, my memory is growing ever more distant from the spot where Naoko .\n",
      "0, used to stand - where my old self used to stand. And nothing but .\n",
      "0, scenery, that view of the meadow in October, returns again and again .\n",
      "172, to me like a symbolic scene in a film. Each time it appears, it delivers .\n",
      "0, 7 .\n",
      "0, a kick to some part of my mind. Wake up, it says. I'm still here. Wake .\n",
      "0, up and think about it. Think about why I'm still here. The kicking .\n",
      "141, never hurts me. There's no pain at all. Just a hollow sound that echoes .\n",
      "0, with each kick. And even that is bound to fade one day. At Hamburg .\n",
      "0, airport, though, the kicks were longer and harder than usual. Which is .\n",
      "0, why I am writing this book. To think. To understand. It just happens .\n",
      "0, to be the way I'm made. I have to write things down to feel I fully .\n",
      "0, comprehend them. .\n",
      "0, Let's see, now, what was Naoko talking about that day? .\n",
      "0, Of course: the \"field well\". I have no idea whether there was such a .\n",
      "149, well. It might have been an image or a sign that existed only inside .\n",
      "172, Naoko, like all the other things she used to spin into existence inside .\n",
      "0, her mind in those dark days. Once she had described it to me, though, .\n",
      "0, I was never able to think of that meadow scene without the well. From .\n",
      "0, that day forward, the image of a thing I had never laid eyes on became .\n",
      "0, inseparably fused to the actual scene of the field that lay before me. I .\n",
      "149, can describe the well in minute detail. It lay precisely on the border .\n",
      "0, where the meadow ended and the woods began - a dark opening in the .\n",
      "0, earth a yard across, hidden by grass. Nothing marked its perimeter - .\n",
      "0, no fence, no stone curb (at least not one that rose above ground level). .\n",
      "0, It was nothing but a hole, a wide-open mouth. The stones of its collar .\n",
      "0, had been weathered and turned a strange muddy-white. They were .\n",
      "0, cracked and chunks were missing, and a little green lizard slithered .\n",
      "0, into an open seam. You could lean over the edge and peer down to see .\n",
      "137, nothing. All I knew about the well was its frightening depth. It was .\n",
      "0, deep beyond measuring, and crammed full of darkness, as if all the .\n",
      "0, world's darknesses had been boiled down to their ultimate density. .\n",
      "242, \"It's really, really deep,\" said Naoko, choosing her words with care. .\n",
      "0, She would speak that way sometimes, slowing down to find the exact .\n",
      "0, word she was looking for. \"But no one knows where it is,\" she .\n",
      "173, continued. \"The one thing I know for sure is that it's around here .\n",
      "0, somewhere.\" .\n",
      "212, Hands thrust into the pockets of her tweed jacket, she smiled at me as .\n",
      "0, if to say \"It's true!\" .\n",
      "134, \"Then it must be incredibly dangerous,\" I said. \"A deep well, but .\n",
      "0, nobody knows where it is. You could fall in and that'd be the end of .\n",
      "0, you.\" .\n",
      "0, \"The end. Aaaaaaaah! Splat! Finished.\" .\n",
      "385, \"Things like that must happen.\" .\n",
      "0, \"They do, every once in a while. Maybe once in two or three years. .\n",
      "0, Somebody disappears all of a sudden, and they just can't find him. So .\n",
      "0, then the people around here say, \"Oh, he fell in the field well’.\" .\n",
      "0, \"Not a nice way to die,\" I said. .\n",
      "0, \"No, it's a terrible way to die,\" said Naoko, brushing a cluster of grass .\n",
      "167, seed from her jacket. \"The best thing would be to break your neck, but .\n",
      "0, you’d probably just break your leg and then you couldn't do a thing. .\n",
      "97, You'd yell at the top of your lungs, but nobody would hear you, and .\n",
      "0, you couldn't expect anyone to find you, and you'd have centipedes and .\n",
      "0, spiders crawling all over you, and the bones of the ones who died .\n",
      "0, before are scattered all around you, and it's dark and soggy, and high .\n",
      "185, overhead there's this tiny, tiny circle of light like a winter moon. You .\n",
      "0, die there in this place, little by little, all by yourself.\" .\n",
      "0, \"Yuck, just thinking about it makes my flesh creep,\" I said. .\n",
      "0, \"Somebody should find the thing and build a wall around it.\" .\n",
      "206, \"But nobody can find it. So make sure you don’t go off the path.\" .\n",
      "546, \"Don't worry, I won’t.\" .\n",
      "390, Naoko took her left hand from her pocket and squeezed my hand. .\n",
      "196, \"Don't you worry,\" she said. \"You'll be OK. You could go running all .\n",
      "0, around here in the middle of the night and you'd never fall into the .\n",
      "160, well. And as long as I stick with you, I won't fall in, either.\" .\n",
      "0, \"Never?\" .\n",
      "0, \"Never!\" .\n",
      "0, \"How can you be so sure?\" .\n",
      "0, 9 .\n",
      "211, \"I just know,\" she said, increasing her grip on my hand and walking .\n",
      "0, along in silence. \"I know these things. I'm always right. It's got .\n",
      "0, nothing to do with logic: I just feel it. For example, when I'm really .\n",
      "288, close to you like this. I'm not the least bit scared. Nothing dark or evil .\n",
      "0, could ever tempt me.\" .\n",
      "0, \"Well, that's the answer,\" I said. \"All you have to do is stay with me .\n",
      "385, like this all the time.\" .\n",
      "0, \"Do you mean that?\" .\n",
      "0, \"Of course.\" .\n",
      "0, Naoko stopped short. So did I. She put her hands on my shoulders and .\n",
      "281, peered into my eyes. Deep within her own pattern. Those beautiful .\n",
      "0, eyes of hers were looking inside me for a long, long time. Then she .\n",
      "0, stretched to her full height and touched her cheek to mine. It was a .\n",
      "423, marvelous, warm gesture that stopped my heart for a moment. .\n",
      "714, \"Thank you.\" .\n",
      "0, \"My pleasure,\" I answered. .\n",
      "331, \"I'm so happy you said that. Really happy,\" she said with a sad smile. .\n",
      "0, \"But it's impossible.\" .\n",
      "0, \"Impossible? Why?\" .\n",
      "0, \"It would be wrong. It would be terrible. It -\" .\n",
      "0, Naoko clamped her mouth shut and started walking again. I could tell .\n",
      "0, that all kinds of thoughts were whirling around in her head, so rather .\n",
      "0, than intrude on them I kept silent and walked by her side. .\n",
      "0, \"It would be wrong - wrong for you, wrong for me,\" she said after a .\n",
      "0, long pause. .\n",
      "0, \"Wrong how?\" I murmured. .\n",
      "0, \"Don't you see? It's just not possible for one person to watch over .\n",
      "0, another person forever and ever. I mean, suppose we got married. .\n",
      "0, You’d have to work during the day. Who's going to watch over me .\n",
      "0, while you're away? Or if you go on a business trip, who's going to .\n",
      "0, watch over me then? Can I be glued to you every minute of our lives? .\n",
      "0, What kind of equality would there be in that? What kind of .\n",
      "0, 10 .\n",
      "0, relationship would that be? Sooner or later you'd get sick of me. You'd .\n",
      "0, wonder what you were doing with your life, why you were spending .\n",
      "0, all your time babysitting this woman. I couldn’t stand that. It wouldn't .\n",
      "310, solve any of my problems.\" .\n",
      "0, \"But your problems are not going to continue for the rest of your life,\" .\n",
      "0, I said, touching her back. \"They'll end eventually. And when they do, .\n",
      "0, we'll stop and think about how to go on from there. Maybe you will .\n",
      "197, have to help me. We're not running our lives according to some .\n",
      "0, account book. If you need me, use me. Don't you see? Why do you .\n",
      "175, have to be so rigid? Relax, let down your guard. You're all tensed up .\n",
      "153, so you always expect the worst. Relax your body, and the rest of you .\n",
      "0, will lighten up.\" .\n",
      "107, \"How can you say that?\" she asked in a voice drained of feeling. .\n",
      "0, Naoko's voice alerted me to the possibility that I had said something I .\n",
      "0, shouldn’t have. .\n",
      "0, \"Tell me how you could say such a thing,\" she said, staring at the .\n",

      "195, already. \"Relax your body, and the rest of you will lighten up.' What's .\n",
      "186, the point of saying that to me? If I relaxed my body now. I'd fall apart. .\n",
      "152, I've always lived like this, and it's the only way I know how to go on .\n",
      "198, living. If I relaxed for a second. I'd never find my way back. I’d go to .\n",
      "0, pieces, and the pieces would be blown away. Why can't you see that? .\n",
      "0, How can you talk about watching over me if you can't see that?\" .\n",
      "0, I said nothing. .\n",
      "0, \"I'm confused. Really confused. And it's a lot deeper than you think. .\n",
      "0, Deeper ... darker ... colder. But tell me something. How could you .\n",
      "0, have slept with me that time? How could you have done such a thing? .\n",
      "161, Why didn't you just leave me alone?\" .\n",
      "0, Now we were walking through the frightful silence of a pine forest. .\n",

      "0, mean. I try to correct myself, and that only makes it worse. I lose track .\n",
      "143, of what I was trying to say to begin with. It's like I'm split in two and .\n",
      "130, playing tag with myself. One half is chasing the other half around this .\n",

      "0, We boarded the Yamanote Line, and Naoko transferred to the Chuo .\n",

      "0, missions. The school was so refined you were considered unrefined if .\n",
      "259, you studied too much. Naoko was the girlfriend of my best (and only) .\n",
      "225, friend. Kizuki. The two of them had been close almost from birth, .\n",
      "0, their houses not 200 yards apart. .\n",
      "0, As with most couples who have been together since childhood, there .\n",
      "318, was a casual openness about the relationship of Kizuki and Naoko and .\n",
      "0, little sense that they wanted to be alone together. They were always .\n",
      "153, visiting each other's homes and eating or playing mah-jong with each .\n",

      "186, would bring a school friend for me and the four of us would go to the .\n",
      "0, zoo or the pool or the cinema. The girls she brought were always .\n",

      "0, understand me, either. .\n",
      "0, After a while, Kizuki gave up trying to arrange dates for me, and .\n",
      "0, instead the three of us would do things together. Kizuki and Naoko .\n",
      "336, and I: odd, but that was the most comfortable combination. .\n",
      "0, Introducing a fourth person into the mix would always make things a .\n",
      "181, little awkward. We were like a TV talk show, with me the guest, .\n",
      "383, Kizuki the talented host, and Naoko his assistant. He was good at .\n",
      "0, 27 .\n",
      "203, occupying that central position. True, he had a sarcastic side that often .\n",
      "370, struck people as arrogant, but in fact he was a considerate and fair- .\n",
      "167, minded person. He would distribute his remarks and jokes fairly to .\n",
      "176, Naoko and to me, taking care to see that neither of us felt left out. If .\n",
      "0, one or the other stayed quiet too long, he would steer his conversation .\n",
      "0, in that direction and get the person to talk. It probably looked harder .\n",
      "0, than it was: he knew how to monitor and adjust the air around him on .\n",
      "237, a second-by-second basis. In addition, he had a rare talent for finding .\n",
      "252, the interesting parts of someone's generally uninteresting comments so .\n",
      "0, that, while speaking to him, you felt you were an exceptionally .\n",
      "519, interesting person with an exceptionally interesting life. .\n",
      "319, And yet he was not the least bit sociable. I was his only real friend at .\n",
      "398, school. I could never understand why such a smart and capable talker .\n",
      "0, did not turn his talents to the broader world around him but remained .\n",
      "219, satisfied to concentrate on our little trio. Nor could I understand why .\n",
      "316, he picked me to be his friend. I was just an ordinary kid who liked to .\n",
      "0, read books and listen to music and didn't stand out in any way that .\n",
      "168, would prompt someone like Kizuki to pay attention to me. We hit it .\n",
      "160, off straight away, though. His father was a dentist, known for his .\n",
      "0, professional skill and his high fees. .\n",
      "106, \"Want to double-date Sunday?\" he asked me just after we met. \"My .\n",

      "0, you.\" .\n",
      "0, \"Sure,\" I said, and that was how I met Naoko. .\n",
      "0, The three of us spent a lot of time together, but whenever Kizuki left .\n",
      "0, the room, Naoko and I had trouble talking to each other. We never .\n",
      "0, knew what to talk about. And in fact there was no topic of .\n",
      "0, conversation that we had in common. Instead of talking, we'd drink .\n",
      "0, water or toy with something on the table and wait for Kizuki to come .\n",
      "0, back and start up the conversation again. Naoko was not particularly .\n",
      "0, talkative, and I was more of a listener than a talker, so I felt .\n",
      "0, 28 .\n",
      "0, uncomfortable when I was left alone with her. Not that we were .\n",
      "0, incompatible: we just had nothing to talk about. .\n",
      "0, Naoko and I saw each other only once after Kizuki's funeral. Two .\n",
      "198, weeks after the event, we met at a cafe to take care of some minor .\n",
      "84, matter, and when that was finished we had nothing more to say. I tried .\n",
      "0, raising several different topics, but none of them led anywhere. And .\n",
      "0, when Naoko did talk, there was an edge to her voice. She seemed .\n",
      "0, angry with me, but I had no idea why. We never saw each other again .\n",
      "0, until that day a year later we happened to meet on the Chuo Line in .\n",
      "0, Tokyo. .\n",
      "0, Naoko might have been angry with me because I, not she, had been .\n",
      "0, the last one to see Kizuki. That may not be the best way to put it, but I .\n",
      "0, more or less understood how she felt. I would have swapped places .\n",
      "0, with her if I could have, but finally, what had happened had happened, .\n",
      "0, and there was nothing I could do about it. .\n",
      "203, It had been a nice afternoon in May. After lunch, Kizuki suggested we .\n",
      "420, skip classes and go play pool or something. I had no special interest in .\n",
      "0, my afternoon classes, so together we left school, ambled down the hill .\n",
      "357, to a pool hall on the harbour, and played four games. When I won the .\n",
      "264, first, easy-going game, he became serious and won the next three. .\n",
      "0, This meant I paid, according to our custom. Kizuki didn't make a .\n",
      "338, single joke as we played, which was most unusual. We smoked .\n",
      "0, afterwards. .\n",
      "0, \"Why so serious?\" I asked. .\n",
      "405, \"I didn’t want to lose today,\" said Kizuki with a satisfied smile. .\n",
      "0, He died that night in his garage. He led a rubber hose from the exhaust .\n",
      "0, pipe of his N-360 to a window, taped over the gap in the window, and .\n",
      "0, revved the engine. I have no idea how long it took him to die. His .\n",

      "0, going, and a petrol station receipt was tucked under the windscreen .\n",
      "0, 29 .\n",
      "0, wiper. .\n",
      "0, Kizuki had left no suicide note, and had no motive that anyone could .\n",
      "0, think of. Because I had been the last one to see him, I was called in for .\n",
      "0, questioning by the police. I told the investigating officer that Kizuki .\n",
      "0, had given no indication of what he was about to do, that he had been .\n",
      "0, exactly the same as always. The policeman had obviously formed a .\n",
      "415, poor impression of both Kizuki and me, as if it was perfectly natural .\n",
      "167, for the kind of person who would skip classes and play pool to .\n",
      "140, commit suicide. A small article in the paper brought the affair to a .\n",

      "0, with one of the girls at school, but that didn’t last six months. Nothing .\n",

      "0, It's a cliche translated into words, but at the time I felt it not as words .\n",
      "0, but as that knot of air inside me. Death exists - in a paperweight, in .\n",

      "114, The night Kizuki died, however, I lost the ability to see death (and .\n",

      "0, she had dressed with real flair and surrounded herself with a million .\n",

      "0, with my dead friend's girl. I had no idea what I was doing or what I .\n",
      "0, was going to do. For my courses I would read Claudel and Racine and .\n",

      "84, On Saturday nights I would sit by the phone in the lobby, waiting for .\n",

      "0, Come to think of it, what scene had I been a part of in recent years? .\n",
      "0, The last one I could remember was a pool hall near the harbour, where .\n",
      "467, Kizuki and I played pool together in a spirit of total friendship. Kizuki .\n",
      "0, died that night, and ever since a cold, stiffening wind had come .\n",

      "0, ever of some part of my adolescence. But what that meant, and what .\n",
      "0, would come of it, were far beyond my understanding. .\n",

      "174, getting into a nice mood, but when Nagasawa suggested we go .\n",
      "0, somewhere else for a drink, the girls said it was almost curfew time .\n",
      "0, and they had to go back to their dorms. So much for our \"luck\". We .\n",

      "0, My companions at the table turned out to be two girls. They looked .\n",

      "0, Both were reserved in the way they dressed and made up: they were .\n",
      "0, 98 .\n",
      "184, definitely not the type to be wandering around Shinjuku at five in the .\n",
      "0, morning. I guessed they had just happened to miss the last train. They .\n",

      "181, to consume as they carried on what seemed like a serious discussion in .\n",
      "0, hushed tones. The large girl tilted her head several times, while the .\n",
      "0, small one shook hers just as often. I couldn't make out what they were .\n",
      "141, saying because of the loud stereo playing Marvin Gaye or the Bee .\n",
      "0, Gees or something, but it seemed the small girl was angry or upset and .\n",
      "185, the large girl was trying to comfort her. I alternated passages of my .\n",

      "0, m sf .\n",
      "225, Thanks for your letter, wrote Naoko. Her family had forwarded it .\n",

      "0, Having read that much, I opened the window, took off my jacket and .\n",

      "0, from Naoko, I gave myself up to an endless stream of feelings. It .\n",
      "0, seemed as if the colours of the real world around me had begun to .\n",
      "0, drain away from my having done nothing more than read a few lines .\n",
      "0, she had written. I closed my eyes and spent a long time collecting my .\n",

      "0, It's almost four months since I came here, she went on. .\n",
      "0, I've thought a lot about you in that time. The more I've thought, the .\n",
      "0, more I've come to feel that I was unfair to you. I probably should have .\n",
      "209, been a better, fairer person when it came to the way I treated you. .\n",
      "0, This may not be the most normal way to look at things, though. Girls .\n",

      "0, but I can't help feeling that it is also exactly the right word for me .\n",
      "481, now. And because questions of beauty and happiness have become .\n",
      "0, such difficult and convoluted propositions for me now, I suspect, I .\n",
      "200, find myself clinging instead to other standards - like, whether or not .\n",

      "0, In any case, though, I believe that I have not been fair to you and that, .\n",
      "0, as a result, I must have led you around in circles and hurt you deeply. .\n",
      "0, In doing so, however, I have led myself around in circles and hurt .\n",
      "0, myself just as deeply. I say this not as an excuse or a means of self¬ .\n",
      "236, justification but because it is true. If I have left a wound inside you, it .\n",
      "436, is not just your wound but mine as well. So please try not to hate me. I .\n",
      "0, am a flawed human being - a far more flawed human being than you .\n",

      "0, This may be an over-analytical way of looking at things. Don't you .\n",
      "380, agree? The therapy they perform here is certainly not over-analytical, .\n",
      "0, but when you are under treatment for several months the way I am .\n",

      "167, in her hands. Then she asked me if I played tennis. I knew how to .\n",
      "148, play, I said, but I was bad at it. .\n",
      "0, \"How about basketball?\" .\n",
      "0, \"Not my strongest sport,\" I said. .\n",

      "0, no more than ten inches apart, but she was light years away from me. .\n",
      "98, I reached out and tried to touch her, but Naoko drew back, lips .\n",
      "0, trembling faintly. A moment later, she brought her hands .\n",
      "0, up and began slowly to undo the buttons of her gown. There were .\n",
      "133, seven in all. I felt as if it were the continuation of my dream as I .\n",
      "257, watched her slim, lovely fingers opening the buttons one by one from .\n",
      "153, top to bottom. Seven small, white buttons: when she had unfastened .\n",
      "0, them all, Naoko slipped the gown from her shoulders and threw it off .\n",
      "218, completely like an insect shedding its skin. She had been wearing .\n",
      "0, 158 .\n",
      "0, nothing under the gown. All she had on was the butterfly hairslide. .\n",
      "0, Naked now, and still kneeling by the bed, she looked at me. Bathed in .\n",
      "0, the soft light of the moon, Naoko's body had the heartbreaking lustre .\n",
      "0, of newborn flesh. When she moved - and she did so almost .\n",
      "194, imperceptibly - the play of light and shadow on her body shifted .\n",
      "0, subtly. The swelling roundness of her breasts, her tiny nipples, the .\n",
      "0, indentation of her navel, her hipbones and pubic hair, all cast grainy .\n",
      "217, shadows, the shapes of which kept changing like ripples spreading .\n",
      "315, over the calm surface of a lake. .\n",
      "285, What perfect flesh! I thought. When had Naoko come to possess such .\n",
      "236, a perfect body? What had happened to the body I held in my arms that .\n",
      "0, night last spring? .\n",
      "0, A sense of imperfection had been what Naoko's body had given me .\n",
      "182, that night as I tenderly undressed her while she cried. Her breasts had .\n",
      "0, seemed hard, the nipples oddly jutting, the hips strangely rigid. She .\n",
      "281, was a beautiful girl, of course, her body marvellous and alluring. It .\n",
      "0, aroused me that night and swept me along with a gigantic force. But .\n",
      "178, still, as I held her and caressed her and kissed her naked flesh, I felt a .\n",
      "211, strange and powerful awareness of the imbalance and awkwardness of .\n",
      "0, the human body. Holding Naoko in my arms, I wanted to explain to .\n",
      "0, her, \"I am having sex with you now. I am inside you. But really this is .\n",
      "79, nothing. It doesn't matter. It is nothing but the joining of two bodies. .\n",
      "0, All we are doing is telling each other things that can only be told by .\n",
      "0, the rubbing together of two imperfect lumps of flesh. By doing this, .\n",
      "160, we are sharing our imperfection.\" But of course I could never have .\n",
      "209, said such a thing with any hope of being understood. I just went on .\n",
      "0, holding her tightly. And as I did so, I was able to feel inside her body .\n",
      "99, some kind of stony foreign matter, something extra that I could never .\n",
      "0, draw close to. And that sensation both filled my heart for Naoko and .\n",
      "0, gave my erection a terrifying intensity. .\n",
      "0, The body that Naoko revealed before me now, though, was nothing .\n",
      "172, like the one I had held that night. This flesh had been through many .\n",
      "0, 159 .\n",
      "236, changes to be reborn in utter perfection beneath the light of the moon. .\n",
      "0, All signs of girlish plumpness had been stripped away since Kizuki's .\n",
      "328, death to be replaced by the flesh of a mature woman. So perfect was .\n",
      "275, Naoko's physical beauty now that it aroused nothing sexual in me. I .\n",
      "375, could only stare, astounded, at the lovely curve from waist to hips, the .\n",
      "404, rounded richness of the breasts, the gentle movement with each breath .\n",
      "0, of the slim belly and the soft, black pubic shadow beneath. .\n",
      "0, She exposed her nakedness to me this way for perhaps five minutes .\n",
      "0, until, at last, she wrapped herself in her gown once more and buttoned .\n",
      "114, it from top to bottom. As soon as the final button was in place, she .\n",
      "0, rose and glided towards the bedroom, silently opened the door, and .\n",
      "0, disappeared. .\n",
      "0, I stayed rooted to the spot for a very long time until it occurred to me .\n",
      "0, to leave the bed. I retrieved my watch from where it had fallen on the .\n",

      "0, the kitchen and drank a few glasses of water before stretching out in .\n",

      "0, every corner of the room, dissolving all traces of the moon's pale .\n",
      "0, glow. .\n",
      "0, I was somewhere on the edge of sleep when Reiko came and slapped .\n",
      "0, me on the cheek, shouting, \"Morning! Morning!\" .\n",
      "0, While Reiko straightened out my sofa bed, Naoko went to the kitchen .\n",
      "416, and started making breakfast. She smiled at me and said \"Good .\n",
      "0, morning\". .\n",
      "209, \"Good morning,\" I replied. I stood by and watched her as she put on .\n",
      "0, water to boil and sliced some bread, humming all the while, but I .\n",
      "0, could sense nothing in her manner to suggest that she had revealed her .\n",
      "0, naked body to me the night before. .\n",
      "0, \"Your eyes are red,\" she said to me as she poured the coffee. \"Are you .\n",

      "0, \"I woke up in the middle of the night and couldn't get back to sleep.\" .\n",
      "0, \"I bet we were snoring,\" said Reiko. .\n",
      "0, 160 .\n",
      "0, \"Not at all,\" I said. .\n",
      "0, \"That's good,\" said Naoko. .\n",
      "0, \"He's just being polite,\" said Reiko, yawning. .\n",
      "173, At first I thought that Naoko was embarrassed or acting innocent for .\n",
      "0, Reiko, but her behaviour remained unchanged when Reiko .\n",
      "0, momentarily left the room, and her eyes had their usual transparent .\n",
      "0, look. .\n",
      "0, \"How’d you sleep?\" I asked Naoko. .\n",
      "385, \"Like a log,\" she answered with ease. She wore a simple hairpin .\n",
      "0, without any kind of decoration. .\n",
      "0, I didn't know what to make of this, and I continued to feel that way all .\n",
      "0, through breakfast. Buttering my bread or peeling my egg, I kept .\n",
      "0, glancing across the table at Naoko, in search of a sign. .\n",
      "312, \"Why do you keep looking at me like that?\" she asked with a smile. .\n",
      "344, \"I think he’s in love with somebody,\" said Reiko. .\n",
      "344, \"Are you in love with somebody?\" Naoko asked me. .\n",
      "200, \"Could be,\" I said, returning her smile. When the two women started .\n",
      "137, joking around at my expense, I gave up trying to think about what had .\n",
      "0, happened in the night and concentrated on my bread and coffee. .\n",
      "0, After breakfast, Reiko and Naoko said they would be going to feed the .\n",
      "0, birds in the aviary. I volunteered to go along. They changed into jeans .\n",
      "0, and work shirts and white rubber boots. Set in a little park behind the .\n",
      "0, tennis courts, the aviary had everything in it from chickens and .\n",
      "0, pigeons to peacocks and parrots and was surrounded by flowerbeds, .\n",
      "0, shrubberies and benches. Two men in their forties, also apparently .\n",
      "0, sanatorium patients, were raking up leaves that had fallen in the .\n",
      "209, pathways. The women walked over to say good morning to the pair, .\n",
      "359, and Reiko made them laugh with another of her jokes. Cosmos were .\n",
      "210, blooming in the flowerbeds, and the shrubberies were extremely well .\n",
      "0, manicured. Spotting Reiko, the birds started chattering and flying .\n",
      "0, about inside the cage. .\n",
      "0, The women entered the shed by the cage and came out with a bag of .\n",
      "0, 161 .\n",
      "0, feed and a garden hose. Naoko screwed the hose to a tap and turned .\n",
      "264, on the water. Taking care to prevent any birds from flying out, the two .\n",
      "0, of them slipped into the cage, Naoko hosing down the dirt and Reiko .\n",
      "0, scrubbing the floor of the cage with a deck brush. The spray sparkled .\n",
      "0, in the glare of the morning sun. The peacocks flapped around the cage .\n",
      "0, to avoid getting splashed. A turkey raised its head and glowered at me .\n",
      "200, like a crotchety old man, while a parrot on the perch above screeched .\n",
      "0, its displeasure and beat its wings. Reiko meowed at the parrot, which .\n",
      "244, slunk over to the far corner but soon was calling: \"Thank you!\" .\n",
      "0, \"Crazy!\" \"Shithead!\" .\n",
      "0, \"I wonder who taught him that kind of language?\" said Naoko with a .\n",
      "1000, sigh. .\n",
      "0, \"Not me,\" said Reiko. \"I would never do such a thing.\" She started .\n",
      "0, meowing again, and the parrot shut up. .\n",
      "262, Laughing, Reiko explained, \"This guy once had a run-in with a cat. .\n",
      "0, Now he's scared to death of them.\" .\n",
      "0, When they had finished cleaning, the two set down their tools and .\n",
      "0, went around filling each of the feeders. Splashing its way through .\n",
      "0, puddles on the floor, the turkey darted to its feed box and plunged its .\n",
      "0, head in, too obsessed with eating to be bothered by Naoko's smacks .\n",
      "0, on its tail. .\n",
      "0, \"Do you do this every morning?\" I asked Naoko. .\n",
      "0, \"Every morning!\" she said. \"They usually give this job to new women. .\n",
      "499, It's so easy. Like to see the rabbits?\" .\n",
      "0, \"Sure,\" I said. The rabbit hutch was behind the aviary. Some ten .\n",
      "0, rabbits lay inside, asleep in the straw. Naoko swept up their droppings, .\n",
      "0, put feed in their box, and picked up one of the babies, nibbing it .\n",
      "0, against her cheek. .\n",
      "128, \"Isn't it precious?\" she gushed. She let me hold it. The warm, little ball .\n",
      "0, of fur cringed in my arms, twitching its nose. .\n",
      "320, \"Don't worry, he won't hurt you,\" she said to the rabbit, stroking its .\n",
      "462, head with her finger and smiling at me. It was such a radiant smile. .\n",
      "0, 162 .\n",
      "416, without a trace of shadow, that I couldn’t help smiling myself. And .\n",
      "174, what about Naoko last night? I wondered. I knew for certain that it .\n",
      "175, had been the real Naoko and not a dream: she had definitely taken her .\n",
      "0, clothes off and shown her naked body to me. .\n",
      "463, Reiko whistled a lovely rendition of \"Proud Mary\" as she stuffed a .\n",
      "0, plastic bag with the debris they had gathered and tied the opening. I .\n",
      "0, helped them carry the tools and feed bag to the shed. .\n",
      "200, \"Morning is my favourite time of day,\" said Naoko. \"It's like .\n",
      "149, everything's starting out fresh and new. I begin to get sad around noon .\n",
      "0, time, and I hate it when the sun goes down. I live with those same .\n",
      "0, feelings clay aster day. .\n",
      "0, \"And while you're living with those feelings, you youngsters get old .\n",
      "333, just like me,\" said Reiko with a smile. \"You're thinking about how it's .\n",
      "0, morning now or night and the next thing you know, you're old.\" .\n",
      "351, \"But you like getting old,\" said Naoko. .\n",
      "199, \"Not really,\" said Reiko. \"But I sure don't wish I was young again.\" .\n",
      "0, \"Why not?\" I asked. .\n",
      "0, \"Because it's such a pain in the neck!\" she said. Then she tossed her .\n",
      "205, broom in and closed the door of the shed, whistling \"Proud Mary\" all .\n",
      "0, the while. .\n",
      "0, Back at the flat, the women changed their boots for tennis shoes and .\n",
      "0, said they were going to the farm. Reiko suggested I stayed behind .\n",
      "200, with a book or something because the work would be no fun to watch .\n",
      "0, and they would be doing it as part of a group. \"And while you're .\n",

      "0, \"You're kidding,\" I said, taken aback. .\n",
      "411, \"Of course I am,\" she laughed. \"You're so sweet. Isn’t he, Naoko?\" .\n",
      "314, \"He really is,\" said Naoko, laughing with her. .\n",
      "136, \"I'll work on my German,\" I said with a sigh. .\n",
      "435, \"Yeah, do your homework like a good boy,\" said Reiko. .\n",
      "0, 163 .\n",
      "0, \"We'll be back before lunch.\" .\n",
      "0, The two of them went out tittering. I heard the footsteps and voices of .\n",

      "0, I went into the bathroom and washed my face again, then borrowed a .\n",
      "0, nail clipper and trimmed my nails. For a bathroom that was being .\n",

      "444, some neatly arranged bottles .\n",
      "0, of cleansing cream and lip moisturizer and sun block, there was .\n",

      "0, swept blue, with only a trace of white cloud clinging to the dome of .\n",

      "0, wall of Ami Hostel for a time, then moved away to climb a steep, .\n",
      "0, narrow trail in single file. Reiko led the way, with Naoko in the .\n",

      "0, a thing about them. I don't know their names, I don't remember their .\n",
      "0, faces. I slept with each of them exactly once. Meet 'em, do it, so long. .\n",
      "0, That's it. What's wrong with that?\" .\n",
      "0, \"What I can't stand is that arrogance of yours,\" said Hatsumi in a soft .\n",
      "0, voice. \"Whether you sleep with other women or not is beside the .\n",
      "209, point. I've never really been angry with you for sleeping around, have .\n",

      "0, \"You can't even call what I do sleeping around. It's just a game. .\n",

      "0, Nobody gets hurt,\" said Nagasawa. .\n",
      "0, \"I get hurt,\" said Hatsumi. \"Why am I not enough for you?\" .\n",
      "0, Nagasawa kept silent for a moment and swirled the whisky in his .\n",
      "0, glass. \"It's not that you're not enough for me. That's another phase, .\n",
      "0, another question. It's just a hunger I have inside me. If I've hurt you. .\n",
      "0, I'm sorry. But it's not a question of whether or not you're enough for .\n",
      "0, me. I can only live with that hunger. That's the kind of man I am. .\n",
      "0, That's what makes me me. There's nothing I can do about it, don't you .\n",
      "0, see?\" .\n",
      "0, At last Hatsumi picked up her silverware and started eating her fish. .\n",
      "0, \"At least you shouldn’t drag Torn into your \"games'.\" .\n",
      "0, \"We're a lot alike, though, Watanabe and me,\" said Nagasawa. .\n",
      "390, \"Neither of us is interested, essentially, in anything but ourselves. OK. .\n",
      "0, so I'm arrogant and he's not, but neither of us is able to feel any .\n",
      "200, interest in anything other than what we ourselves think or feel or do. .\n",
      "0, That's why we can think about things in a way that's totally divorced .\n",
      "200, from anybody else. That's what I like about him. The only difference .\n",
      "0, is that he hasn't realized this about himself, and so he hesitates and .\n",
      "0, feels hurt.\" .\n",
      "185, \"What human being doesn't hesitate and feel hurt?\" Hatsumi .\n",

      "0, \"Of course I have, but I've disciplined myself to where I can minimize .\n",

      "0, \"But rats don't fall in love.\" .\n",
      "272, \"\"Rats don't fall in love'.\" Nagasawa looked at me. \"That's great. We .\n",

      "0, \"Don't make fun of me. I'm serious.\" .\n",
      "0, -We're eating,\" said Nagasawa. \"And Watanabe's here. It .night be .\n",

      "0, \"At least have dessert,\" said Nagasawa. .\n",
      "0, \"I don’t mind, really.\" .\n",
      "0, The three of us went on eating in silence for a time. I finished my fish. .\n",
      "0, Hatsumi left half of hers. Nagasawa had polished off his duck long .\n",
      "0, before and was now concentrating on his whisky. .\n",
      "137, \"That was excellent sea bass,\" I offered, but no one took me up on it. I .\n",
      "375, might as well have thrown a rock down a deep well. .\n",
      "0, The waiters took away our plates and brought lemon sherbet and .\n",
      "0, espresso. Nagasawa barely touched his dessert and coffee, moving .\n",
      "0, directly to a cigarette. Hatsumi ignored her sherbet. \"Oh boy,\" I .\n",
      "0, thought to myself as I finished my sherbet and coffee. Hatsumi stared .\n",
      "172, at her hands on the table. Like everything she wore, her hands looked .\n",
      "394, chic and elegant and expensive. I thought about Naoko and Reiko. .\n",
      "0, What would they be doing now? I wondered. Naoko could be lying on .\n",
      "167, the sofa reading a book, and Reiko might be playing \"Norwegian .\n",
      "250, Wood\" on her guitar. I felt an intense desire to go back to that little .\n",
      "0, room of theirs. What the hell was I doing in this place? .\n",
      "210, \"Where Watanabe and I are alike is, we don't give a shit if nobody .\n",
      "0, understands us,\" Nagasawa said. \"That's what makes us different from .\n",
      "0, everybody else. They're all worried about whether the people around .\n",
      "0, them understand them. But not me, and not Watanabe. We just don't .\n",
      "0, give a shit. Self and others are separate.\" .\n",
      "0, \"Is this true?\" Hatsumi asked me. .\n",
      "0, \"No,\" I said. \"I'm not that strong. I don't feel it's OK if nobody .\n",
      "126, understands me. I've got people I want to understand and be .\n",
      "194, understood by. But aside from those few, well, I feel it's kind of .\n",
      "209, hopeless. I don't agree with Nagasawa. I do care if people understand .\n",
      "0, me.\" .\n",
      "0, \"That's practically the same thing as what I'm saying,\" said Nagasawa, .\n",
      "0, picking up his coffee spoon. \"It is the same! It's the difference .\n",
      "0, 250 .\n",
      "0, between a late breakfast or an early lunch. Same time, same food, .\n",
      "0, different name.\" .\n",
      "0, Now Hatsumi spoke to Nagasawa. \"Don't you care whether I .\n",
      "0, understand you or not?\" .\n",
      "0, \"You don’t get it, do you? Person A understands Person B because the .\n",
      "0, time is right for that to happen, not because Person B wants to be .\n",
      "0, understood by Person A.\" .\n",
      "81, \"So is it a mistake for me to feel that I want to be understood by .\n",
      "0, someone - by you, for example?\" .\n",
      "0, \"No, it’s not a mistake,\" answered Nagasawa. \"Most people would call .\n",
      "333, that love, if you think you want to understand me. My system for .\n",
      "0, living is way different from other people's systems for living.\" .\n",
      "0, \"So what you're saying is you're not in love with me, is that it?\" .\n",
      "0, \"Well, my system and your -\" .\n",
      "0, \"To hell with your fucking system!\" Hatsumi shouted. That .\n",
      "0, was the first and last time I ever heard her shout. .\n",
      "0, Nagasawa pushed the button by the table, and the waiter .\n",
      "206, came in with the bill. Nagasawa handed him a credit card. \"Sony .\n",
      "0, about this, Watanabe,\" said Nagasawa. \"I'm going .\n",
      "0, to see Hatsumi home. You go back to the donn alone, OK?\" \"You .\n",
      "218, don't have to apologize to me. Great meal,\" I said, but .\n",
      "0, no one said anything in response. .\n",
      "0, The waiter brought the card, and Nagasawa signed with a ballpoint .\n",
      "0, pen after checking the amount. Then the three of us stood and went .\n",
      "95, outside. Nagasawa started to step into the street to hail a taxi, but .\n",
      "0, Hatsumi stopped him. .\n",
      "0, \"Thanks, but I don't want to spend any more time with you today. You .\n",
      "217, don’t have to see me home. Thank you for dinner.\" .\n",
      "0, ..Whatever,\" said Nagasawa. .\n",
      "178, \"I want Tom to see me home.\" .\n",
      "0, \"Whatever,\" said Nagasawa. \"But Watanabe's practically the same as .\n",
      "110, me. He may be a nice guy, but deep down in his heart he's incapable .\n",
      "0, 251 .\n",
      "281, of loving anybody. There's always some part of him somewhere that's .\n",
      "0, wide awake and detached. He just has that hunger that won't go away. .\n",
      "0, Believe me, I know what I'm talking about.\" .\n",
      "0, I flagged down a taxi and let Hatsumi in first. \"Anyway,\" I said to .\n",
      "277, Nagasawa, \"I'll make sure she gets home.\" .\n",
      "0, \"Sorry to put you through this,\" said Nagasawa, but I could see that he .\n",
      "0, was already thinking about something else. .\n",
      "106, Once inside the cab, I asked Hatsumi, \"Where do you want to go? .\n",
      "0, Back to Ebisu?\" Her flat was in Ebisu. .\n",
      "0, She shook her head. .\n",
      "0, \"OK. How about a drink somewhere?\" .\n",
      "0, \"Yes,\" she said with a nod. .\n",
      "0, \"Shibuya,\" I told the driver. .\n",
      "0, Folding her arms and closing her eyes, Hatsumi sank back into the .\n",
      "0, comer of the seat. Her small gold earrings caught the light as the taxi .\n",
      "0, swayed. Her midnight-blue dress seemed to have been made to match .\n",
      "0, the darkness of the interior. Every now and then her lightly made-up, .\n",
      "270, beautifully formed lips would quiver slightly as though she had caught .\n",
      "0, herself on the verge of talking to herself. Watching her, I could see .\n",
      "213, why Nagasawa had chosen her as his special companion. There were .\n",
      "407, any number of women more beautiful than Hatsumi, and Nagasawa .\n",
      "0, could have made any of them his. But Hatsumi had some quality that .\n",
      "0, could send a tremor through your heart. It was nothing forceful. The .\n",
      "0, power she exerted was a subtle thing, but it called forth deep .\n",
      "0, resonances. I watched her all the way to Shibuya, and wondered, .\n",
      "179, without ever finding an answer, what this emotional reverberation .\n",
      "273, could be that I was feeling. .\n",
      "0, It finally hit me some dozen or so years later. I had gone to Santa Fe .\n",
      "0, to interview a painter and was sitting in a local pizza parlour, drinking .\n",
      "328, beer and eating pizza and watching a miraculously beautiful sunset. .\n",
      "412, Everything was soaked in brilliant red - my hand, the plate, the table. .\n",
      "0, 252 .\n",
      "172, the world - as if some special kind of fruit juice had splashed down on .\n",
      "0, everything. In the midst of this overwhelming sunset, the image of .\n",
      "0, Hatsumi flashed into my mind, and in that moment I understood what .\n",
      "0, that tremor of the heart had been. It was a kind of childhood longing .\n",
      "0, that had always remained - and would for ever remain - unfulfilled. I .\n",
      "287, had forgotten the existence of such innocent, almost burnt-in longing: .\n",
      "0, forgotten for years that such feelings had ever existed inside me. What .\n",
      "0, Hatsumi had stirred in me was a part of my very self that had long lain .\n",
      "0, dormant. And when the realization struck me, it aroused such sorrow I .\n",
      "220, almost burst into tears. She had been an absolutely special woman. .\n",
      "286, Someone should have done something - anything - to save her. .\n",
      "0, But neither Nagasawa nor I could have managed that. As so many of .\n",
      "280, those I knew had done, Hatsumi reached a certain stage in life and .\n",
      "0, decided - almost on the spur of the moment - to end it. Two years after .\n",
      "0, Nagasawa left for Germany, she married, and two years after that she .\n",
      "0, slashed her wrists with a razor blade. .\n",
      "0, It was Nagasawa, of course, who told me what had .\n",
      "0, happened. His letter from Bonn said this: \"Hatsumi's death has .\n",
      "0, extinguished something. This is unbearably sad and painful, even to .\n",
      "0, me.\" I ripped his letter to shreds and threw it away. I never wrote to .\n",
      "0, him again. .\n",
      "0, Hatsumi and I went to a small bar and downed several drinks. Neither .\n",
      "171, of us said much. Like a bored, old married couple, we sat opposite .\n",
      "0, each other, drinking in silence and munching peanuts. When the place .\n",
      "0, began to fill up, we went for a walk. Hatsumi said she would pay the .\n",
      "0, bill, but I insisted on paying because the drinks had been my idea. .\n",
      "0, There was a deep chill in the night air. Hatsumi wrapped herself in her .\n",
      "90, pale grey cardigan and walked by my side in silence. I had no .\n",
      "0, destination in mind as we ambled through the nighttime streets, my .\n",
      "185, hands shoved deep into my pockets. This was just like walking with .\n",
      "0, Naoko, it occurred to me. .\n",
      "0, 253 .\n",
      "194, \"Do you know somewhere we could play pool around here?\" Hatsumi .\n",
      "404, asked me without warning. .\n",
      "0, \"Pool? You play?\" .\n",
      "550, \"Yeah, I'm pretty good. How about you?\" .\n",
      "411, \"I play a little. Not that I'm very good at it.\" .\n",
      "0, \"OK. then. Let's go.\" .\n",
      "0, We found a pool hall nearby and went in. It was a small place at the .\n",
      "123, far end of an alley. The two of us - Hatsumi in her chic dress and I in .\n",
      "0, my blue blazer and regimental tie - clashed with the scruffy pool hall, .\n",
      "0, but this didn't seem to concern Hatsumi at all as she chose and chalked .\n",
      "0, her cue. She pulled a hairslide from her bag and clipped her hair aside .\n",
      "0, at one temple to keep it from interfering with her game. .\n",
      "306, We played two games. Hatsumi was as good as she had claimed to be, .\n",
      "0, while my own game was hampered by the thick bandage I still wore .\n",
      "311, on my cut hand. She crashed me. .\n",
      "467, \"You’re great,\" I said in admiration. .\n",
      "0, \"You mean appearances can be deceiving?\" she asked as she sized up .\n",
      "750, a shot, smiling. .\n",
      "450, \"Where did you learn to play like that?\" .\n",
      "0, \"My grandfather - my father's father - was an old playboy. He had a .\n",
      "305, table in his house. I used to play pool with my brother just for fun, and .\n",
      "0, when I got a little bigger my grandfather taught me the right moves. .\n",
      "379, He was a wonderful guy - stylish, handsome. He's dead now, though. .\n",
      "0, He always used to boast how he once met Deanna Durbin in New .\n",
      "0, York.\" .\n",
      "0, She got three in a row, then missed on the fourth try. I managed to .\n",
      "261, squeeze out a point, then missed an easy shot. .\n",
      "263, \"It's the bandage,\" said Hatsumi to comfort me. .\n",
      "0, \"No, it's because I haven't played for so long,\" I said. \"Two years and .\n",
      "0, five months.\" .\n",
      "272, \"How can you be so sure of the time?\" .\n",
      "0, 254 .\n",
      "203, \"My friend died the night after our last game together,\" I said. .\n",
      "0, \"So you stopped playing?\" .\n",
      "167, \"No, not really,\" I said after giving it some thought. \"I just never had .\n",
      "483, the opportunity to play after that. That's all.\" \"How did your friend .\n",
      "0, die?\" .\n",
      "0, \"Traffic accident.\" .\n",
      "0, She made several more shots, aiming with deadly seriousness and .\n",
      "242, adjusting the strength of each shot with precision. Watching her in .\n",
      "120, action - her carefully set hair swept back out of her eyes, golden .\n",
      "400, earrings sparkling, court shoes set firmly on the floor, lovely, slender .\n",
      "0, fingers pressing the green baize as she took her shot - I felt as if her .\n",
      "0, side of the scruffy pool hall had been transformed into part of some .\n",
      "205, elegant social event. I had never spent time with her alone before, and .\n",
      "0, this was a marvellous experience for me, as though I had been drawn .\n",
      "0, up to a higher plane of life. At the end of the third game - in which, of .\n",
      "0, course, she crushed me again -my cut began to throb, and so we .\n",
      "486, stopped playing. .\n",
      "185, \"I'm sorry,\" she said with what seemed like genuine concern. \"I should .\n",
      "0, never have suggested this.\" .\n",
      "426, \"That's OK,\" I said. \"It's not a bad cut, I enjoyed playing. Really.\" .\n",
      "0, As we were leaving the pool hall, the skinny woman owner said to .\n",
      "545, Hatsumi, \"You've a good eye, sister.\" Hatsumi gave her a sweet smile .\n",
      "293, and thanked her as she paid the bill. .\n",
      "0, \"Does it hurt?\" she asked when we were outside. .\n",
      "0, \"Not much,\" I said. .\n",
      "0, \"Do you think it opened?\" .\n",
      "0, \"No, it’s probably OK.\" .\n",
      "0, \"I know! You should come to my place. I'll change your bandage for .\n",

      "0, there.\" .\n",
      "235, I told her it wasn't worth worrying about, that I’d be OK. but she .\n",
      "0, insisted we had to check to see if the cut had opened or not. .\n",
      "0, 255 .\n",
      "75, \"Or is it that you don't like being with me? You want to go back to .\n",

      "0, \"No way,\" I said. .\n",
      "0, \"All right, then. Don’t stand on ceremony. It's a short walk.\" .\n",
      "0, Hatsumi's flat was a 15-minute walk from Shibuya towards Ebisu. By .\n",
      "374, no means a glamorous building, it was more than decent, with a nice .\n",
      "0, little lobby and a lift. Hatsumi sat me at the kitchen table and went to .\n",

      "0, first-aid box on the table, she undid my bandage, checked to see that .\n",
      "0, the wound was still sealed, put a little disinfectant on the area and tied .\n",

      "281, \"I used to do volunteer work at a hospital. Kind of like playing nurse. .\n",
      "0, That's how I learned.\" .\n",
      "0, When Hatsumi had finished with the bandage, she went and fetched .\n",
      "0, two cans of beer from the fridge. She drank half of hers, and I drank .\n",
      "0, mine plus the half she left. Then she showed me pictures of the other .\n",

      "0, Looking back, I see now that the first symptom of her problem was .\n",
      "139, her loss of the ability to write letters. That happened around the end of .\n",
      "0, November or beginning of December. Then she started hearing things. .\n",
      "0, Whenever she would try to write a letter, she would hear people .\n",
      "0, talking to her, which made it impossible for her to write. The voices .\n",

      "0, that bad until about the time of your second visit, so I didn't take it too .\n",
      "0, seriously. For all of us here, these kinds of symptoms come in cycles, .\n",
      "0, more or less. In her case, they got quite serious after you left. She is .\n",

      "172, you to one of our sessions if possible, and the doctor was in favour of .\n",
      "0, it, but Naoko was against it. I can tell you exactly what her reason .\n",
      "235, was: \"I want my body to be clean of all this when I meet him.\" That .\n",
      "355, was not the problem, I said to her; the problem was to get her well as .\n",
      "0, quickly as possible, and I pushed as hard as I could, but she wouldn’t .\n",
      "0, change her mind. .\n",
      "0, I think I once explained to you that this is not a specialized hospital. .\n",
      "0, We do have medical specialists here, of course, and they provide .\n",
      "314, effective treatments, but concentrated therapy is another matter. The .\n",
      "321, point of this place is to create an effective environment in which the .\n",
      "213, patient can treat herself or himself, and that does not, properly .\n",
      "0, speaking, include medical treatment. Which means that if Naoko's .\n",
      "0, condition grows any worse, they will probably have to transfer her to .\n",
      "0, some other hospital or medical facility or what have you. Personally, I .\n",
      "0, would find this very painful, but we would have to do it. That isn’t to .\n",
      "0, say that she couldn’t come back here for treatment on a kind of .\n",
      "206, temporary \"leave of absence\". Or, better yet, she could even be cured .\n",
      "0, and finish with hospitals completely. In any case, we're doing .\n",
      "276, everything we can, and Naoko is doing everything she can. The best .\n",
      "195, thing you can do meanwhile is hope for her recovery and keep sending .\n",
      "0, her those letters. .\n",
      "0, It was dated 31 March. After I had read it, I stayed on the porch and .\n",
      "0, let my eyes wander out to the garden, full now with the freshness of .\n",
      "0, spring. An old cherry tree stood there, its blossoms nearing the height .\n",
      "226, of their glory. A soft breeze blew, and the light of day lent its .\n",
      "0, strangely blurred, smoky colours to everything. Seagull wandered .\n",

      "0, I knew I should be doing some serious thinking, but I had no idea how .\n",
      "150, to go about it. And, to tell the truth, thinking was the last thing I .\n",
      "0, wanted to do. The time would come soon enough when I had no .\n",

      "286, choice in the matter, and when that time came I would take a good, .\n",
      "0, long while to think things over. Not now, though. Not now. .\n",
      "0, I spent the day staring at the garden, propped against a pillar and .\n",
      "0, stroking Seagull. I felt completely drained. The .\n",
      "0, afternoon deepened, twilight approached, and bluish shadows .\n",
      "0, enveloped the garden. Seagull disappeared, but I went on staring at the .\n",
      "155, cherry blossoms. In the spring gloom, they looked like flesh that had .\n",
      "0, burst through the skin over festering wounds. The garden filled up .\n",
      "196, with the sweet, heavy stench of rotting flesh. And that's when I .\n",
      "262, thought of Naoko's flesh. Naoko's beautiful flesh lay before me in the .\n",
      "0, darkness, countless buds bursting through her skin, green and .\n",

      "0, she pressed against me, put her lips on my nipple and began to move .\n",
      "225, the hand that was wrapped around my penis. The first thing that .\n",
      "0, occurred to me was how different it was to the way Naoko moved her .\n",
      "478, hand. Both were gentle and wonderful, but something was different .\n",

      "338, \"Want to touch my breasts, or down there?\" Midori asked. \"Oh wow. .\n",

      "0, \"Too much?\" .\n",
      "395, \"Nah, it's OK, silly. Come all you want,\" she said with a smile. Then .\n",
      "565, she kissed me. .\n",
      "0, In the evening, Midori did some shopping in the neighbourhood and .\n",
      "0, made dinner. We ate tempura and rice with green peas at the kitchen .\n",

      "0, After saying goodbye to Midori, I bought a newspaper at the station, .\n",
      "231, but when I opened it on the train, I realized I had absolutely no desire .\n",
      "0, to read a paper and in fact couldn't understand what it said. All I could .\n",

      "0, was going to happen to me from now on, and how the things around .\n",
      "0, me would be changing. I felt as if the world was pulsating every now .\n",
      "0, and then. I sighed deeply and closed my eyes. As regards what I had .\n",
      "287, done that day, I felt not the slightest regret; I knew for certain that if I .\n",
      "0, had to do it all over again, I would live this day in exactly the same .\n",
      "0, way. I would hold Midori tight on the roof in the rain; I would get .\n",
      "0, soaking wet with her; and I would let her fingers bring me to climax in .\n",
      "0, 319 .\n",
      "225, her bed. I had no doubts about those things. I loved Midori, and I was .\n",
      "198, happy that she had come back to me. The two of us could make it, that .\n",
      "149, was certain. As Midori herself had said, she was a real, live girl with .\n",
      "119, blood in her veins, and she was putting her warm body in my arms. It .\n",
      "250, had been all I could do to suppress the intense desire I had to strip her .\n",
      "214, naked, throw open her body, and sink myself in her warmth. There .\n",
      "0, was no way I could have made myself stop her once she was holding .\n",
      "186, my penis and moving her hand. I wanted her to do it, she wanted to do .\n",
      "232, it, and we were in love. Who could have stopped such a thing? It was .\n",
      "427, true: I loved Midori. And I had probably known as much for a while. I .\n",
      "0, had just been avoiding the conclusion for a very long time. .\n",
      "0, The problem was that I could never explain these developments to .\n",
      "0, Naoko. It would have been hard enough at any point, but with Naoko .\n",
      "0, in her present condition, there was no way I could tell her I had fallen .\n",
      "448, in love with another girl. And besides, I still loved Naoko. As twisted .\n",
      "433, as that love might be, I did love her. Somewhere inside me there was .\n",
      "0, still preserved a broad, open space, untouched, for Naoko and no one .\n",
      "0, else. .\n",
      "0, One thing I could do was write a letter to Reiko that confessed .\n",
      "242, everything with total honesty. At home, I sat on the veranda, watching .\n",
      "0, the rain pour down on the garden at night, and assembling phrases in .\n",
      "0, my head. Then I went to my desk and wrote the letter. It is almost .\n",
      "172, unbearable to me that I now have to write a letter like this to you, I .\n",
      "0, began. I summarized my relationship with Midori and explained what .\n",
      "0, had happened that day. .\n",
      "451, I have always loved Naoko, and I still love her. But there is a decisive .\n",
      "179, finality to what exists between Midori and me. It has an irresistible .\n",
      "0, power that is bound to sweep me into the future. What I feel for .\n",
      "369, Naoko is a tremendously quiet and gentle and transparent love, but .\n",
      "0, what I feel for Midori is a wholly different emotion. It stands and .\n",
      "0, walks on its own, living and breathing and throbbing and shaking me .\n",
      "0, 320 .\n",
      "0, to the roots of my being. I don't know what to do. I'm confused. I'm .\n",
      "0, not trying to make excuses for myself, but I do believe that I have .\n",
      "346, lived as sincerely as I know how. I have never lied to anyone, and I .\n",
      "332, have taken care over the years not to hurt other people. And yet I find .\n",
      "0, myself tossed into this labyrinth. How can this be? I can't explain it. I .\n",
      "0, don't know what I should do. Can you tell me, Reiko? You're the only .\n",
      "0, one I can turn to for advice. .\n",
      "278, I posted the letter that night by special delivery. .\n",
      "0, Reiko's answer came five days later, dated 17 June. .\n",
      "341, Let me start with the good news. Naoko has been improving far more .\n",
      "0, rapidly than anyone could have expected. I talked to her once on the .\n",
      "0, phone, and she spoke with real lucidity. She may even be able to come .\n",
      "0, back here before long. .\n",
      "0, Now, about you. .\n",
      "287, I think you take everything too seriously. Loving another person is a .\n",
      "465, wonderful thing, and if that love is sincere, no one ends up tossed into .\n",
      "279, a labyrinth. You have to have more faith in yourself. .\n",
      "0, My advice to you is very simple. First of all, if you are drawn so .\n",
      "254, strongly to this Midori person, it is only natural for you to have fallen .\n",
      "504, in love with her. It might go well, or it might not. But love is like that. .\n",
      "340, When you fall in love, the natural thing to do is give yourself to it. .\n",
      "0, That's what I think. It's just a form of sincerity. .\n",
      "0, Second, as to whether or not you should have sex with Midori, that is .\n",
      "0, for you to work out. I can't say a thing. Talk it over with Midori and .\n",
      "109, reach your own conclusion, one that makes sense to you. .\n",
      "0, Third, don't tell any of this to Naoko. If things should develop to the .\n",
      "0, point where you absolutely have to tell her, then you and I will come .\n",
      "180, up with a good plan together. So now, just keep it quiet. Leave it to .\n",
      "0, me. .\n",
      "0, 321 .\n",
      "255, The fourth thing I have to say is that you have been such a great .\n",
      "195, source of strength for Naoko that even if you no longer have the .\n",
      "226, feelings of a lover towards her, there is still a lot you can do for her. .\n",
      "0, So don't brood over everything in that super-serious way of yours. All .\n",

      "0, our lines and angles with rulers and protractors. Am I right? .\n",
      "503, My own personal feeling is that Midori sounds like a great girl. I .\n",
      "0, understand just reading your letter why you would be drawn to her. .\n",
      "0, And I understand, too, why you would also be drawn to Naoko. .\n",
      "146, There's nothing the least bit sinful about it. Things like that happen all .\n",
      "362, the time in this great big world of ours. It's like taking a boat out on a .\n",
      "438, beautiful lake on a beautiful day and thinking both the sky and the .\n",
      "238, lake are beautiful. So stop eating yourself up. Things will go where .\n",
      "172, they're supposed to go if you just let them take their natural course. .\n",
      "0, Despite your best efforts, people are going to be hurt when it's time for .\n",
      "272, them to be hurt. Life is like that. I know I sound like I'm preaching .\n",

      "0, Now that she mentioned it, I saw that Reiko's build was almost .\n",
      "0, identical to Naoko's. Because of the shape of her face and her thin .\n",
      "147, arms and legs, she had always given me the impression of being .\n",

      "0, see her really badly and to have a talk with her. So Naoko and her .\n",
      "0, mother arrived the next day, the 25th, in a taxi. The three of us worked .\n",

      "0, fact, until then I had been very worried. I had been expecting her to be .\n",

      "0, testing and therapy and stuff they do at those hospitals can take it out .\n",
      "0, of you, so I had some real doubts about this visit. But one look at her .\n",
      "291, was all it took to convince me she'd be OK. She looked a lot healthier .\n",
      "329, than I had expected and she was smiling and joking and talking much .\n",
      "0, more normally than when I had seen her last. She had been to the .\n",

      "0, doctors cure her once and for all, and I said that that would probably .\n",
      "219, be the best thing to do. So then the two of us went out for a walk, .\n",
      "0, talking all the time, mainly about the future. Naoko told me that what .\n",
      "157, she’d really like was for the two of us to get out of the sanatorium and .\n",

      "0, been such a load off her mind to feel she knew exactly what she was .\n",
      "0, going to do. So then we finished going through her stuff and throwing .\n",
      "0, what she didn't need into the metal drum in the garden and burning it: .\n",
      "0, the notebook she had used as a diary, and all the letters she had .\n",
      "0, received. Your letters, too. This seemed a bit strange to me, so I asked .\n",
      "0, 337 .\n",
      "172, her why she was burning stuff like that. I mean, she had always been .\n",
      "324, so careful about putting your letters away in a safe place and reading .\n",
      "0, them over and over. She said, \"I'm getting rid of everything from the .\n",

      "0, at her word. It had its own kind of logic to it, sort of. I remember .\n",
      "368, thinking how much I wanted her to get healthy and happy. She was so .\n",

      "342, had been keeping for a special occasion like this and we drank and I .\n",
      "231, played the guitar. The Beatles, as always, \"Norwegian Wood\", .\n",

      "0, started talking about you - about the night she had sex with you. In .\n",

      "0, how she found herself getting wet, how you went inside her, how .\n",
      "209, wonderful it felt: she told me all of this in vivid detail. So I asked her: .\n",
      "0, why are you telling me this now, all of a sudden? I mean, up to then, .\n",
      "0, she had never spoken openly to me about sex. Of course, we had had .\n",
      "0, some frank sexual talk as a kind of therapy, but she had been too .\n",

      "0, face - for ever. I sometimes got the feeling he must be taking out each .\n",

      "0, We had left the train at Yotsuya and were walking along the .\n",

      "0, enjoyed chatting in the sun. .\n",
      "0, Fifteen minutes of walking and I was sweaty enough to take off my .\n",
      "0, thick cotton shirt and go with a T-shirt. Naoko had rolled the sleeves .\n",
      "0, 22 .\n",
      "0, of her light grey sweatshirt up to her elbows. It was nicely faded, .\n",
      "0, obviously having been washed many times. I felt as if I had seen her .\n",
      "160, in that shirt long before. This was just a feeling I had, not a clear .\n",
      "0, memory. I didn't have that much to remember about Naoko at the .\n",

      "0, But it's pretty much the same anywhere you go, you can manage.\" .\n",
      "0, \"I guess so,\" she said with a nod. She seemed to be turning something .\n",

      "0, at some unusual object. Now I saw that her eyes were so deep and .\n",
      "0, clear they made my heart thump. I realized that I had never had .\n",

      "0, \"Are you thinking about living in a dorm or something?\" I asked. .\n",
      "0, \"Uh-uh,\" she said. \"I was just wondering what communal life would .\n",
      "185, be like. And. ..\" She seemed to be trying - and failing - to find exactly .\n",

      "0, I don't know. Never mind.\" .\n",
      "0, That was the end of the conversation. She continued walking east, and .\n",
      "0, I followed just behind. .\n",
      "0, 23 .\n",
      "0, Almost a year had gone by since I had last seen Naoko, and in that .\n",
      "146, time she had lost so much weight as to look like a different person. .\n",
      "0, The plump cheeks that had been a special feature of hers were all but .\n",
      "0, gone, and her neck had become delicate and slender. Not that she was .\n",
      "245, bony now or unhealthy looking: there was something natural and .\n",
      "128, serene about the way she had slimmed down, as if she had been hiding .\n",
      "0, in some long, narrow space until she herself had become long and .\n",
      "0, narrow. And a lot prettier than I remembered. I wanted to tell her that, .\n",
      "308, but couldn't find a good way to put it. .\n",
      "0, We had not planned to meet but had run into each other on the Chuo .\n",
      "0, commuter line. She had decided to see a film by herself, and I was .\n",
      "137, headed for the bookshops in Kanda - nothing urgent in either case. .\n",
      "85, She had suggested that we leave the train, which we happened to do in .\n",
      "0, Yotsuya, where the green embankment makes for a nice place to walk .\n",
      "143, by the old castle moat. Alone together, we had nothing in particular to .\n",
      "165, talk about, and I wasn't quite sure why Naoko had suggested we get .\n",
      "0, off the train. We had never really had much to say to each other. .\n",
      "0, Naoko started walking the minute we hit the street, and I hurried after .\n",
      "0, her, keeping a few paces behind. I could have closed the distance .\n",
      "0, between us, but something held me back. I walked with my eyes on .\n",
      "0, her shoulders and her straight black hair. She wore a big, brown .\n",
      "0, hairslide, and when she turned her head I caught a glimpse of a small, .\n",
      "0, white ear. Now and then she would look back and say something. .\n",
      "0, Sometimes it would be a remark I might have responded to, and some¬ .\n",
      "155, times it would be something to which I had no idea how to reply. .\n",
      "0, Other times, I simply couldn’t hear what she was saying. She didn't .\n",
      "0, seem to care one way or another. Once she had finished saying .\n",
      "0, whatever she wanted to say, she’d face front again and keep on .\n",
      "0, walking. Oh, well, I told myself, it was a nice day for a stroll. .\n",
      "167, This was no mere stroll for Naoko, though, judging from that walk. .\n",
      "0, She turned right at Lidabashi, came out at the moat, crossed the .\n",
      "0, intersection at Jinbocho, climbed the hill at Ochanomizu and came out .\n",
      "0, 24 .\n",
      "0, at Hongo. From there she followed the tram tracks to Komagome. It .\n",
      "0, was a challenging route. By the time we reached Komagome, the sun .\n",
      "0, was sinking and the day had become a soft spring evening. .\n",
      "0, \"Where are we?\" asked Naoko, as if noticing our surroundings for the .\n",
      "0, first time. .\n",
      "0, \"Komagome,\" I said. \"Didn’t you know? We made this big arc.\" .\n",
      "0, \"Why did we come here?\" .\n",
      "0, \"You brought us here. I was just following you.\" .\n",
      "0, We went to a shop by the station for a bowl of noodles. Thirsty, I had .\n",
      "0, a whole beer to myself. Neither of us said a word from the time we .\n",
      "172, gave our order to the time we finished eating. I was exhausted from all .\n",
      "0, that walking, and she just sat there with her hands on the table, .\n",
      "0, mulling something over again. All the leisure spots were crowded on .\n",
      "0, this warm Sunday, they were saying on the TV news. And we just .\n",
      "0, walked from Yotsuya to Komagome, I said to myself. .\n",
      "0, \"Well, you're in good shape,\" I said when I had finished my noodles. .\n",
      "0, \"Surprised?\" .\n",
      "0, \"Yeah.\" .\n",
      "0, \"I was a long distance runner at school, I'll have you know. I used to .\n",
      "0, do the 10,000 metres. And my father took me mountain climbing on .\n",
      "0, Sundays ever since I can remember. You know our house - right there, .\n",
      "0, next to the mountain. I've always had strong legs.\" .\n",
      "0, \"It doesn't show,\" I said. .\n",
      "0, \"I know,\" she answered. \"Everybody thinks I'm this delicate little girl. .\n",
      "0, But you can't judge a book by its cover.\" To which she added a .\n",
      "0, momentary smile. .\n",
      "196, \"And that goes for me, too,\" I said. \"I'm worn out.\" .\n",
      "85, \"Oh, I'm sorry. I've been dragging you around all day.\" \"Still, I'm glad .\n",
      "0, we had a chance to talk. We've never done that before, just the two of .\n",
      "214, us,\" I said, trying without success to recall what we had talked about. .\n",
      "0, She was playing with the ashtray on the table. .\n",
      "0, \"I wonder. ..\" she began, \". . . if you wouldn’t mind ... I mean, if it .\n",
      "0, 25 .\n",
      "0, really wouldn't be any bother to you ... Do you think we could see .\n",
      "0, each other again? I know I don’t have any right to be asking you this.\" .\n",
      "0, \"Any right? What do you mean by that?\" .\n",
      "0, She blushed. My reaction t> her request might have been a little too .\n",
      "0, strong. .\n",
      "0, \"I don't know ... I can’t really explain it,\" she said, tugging the sleeves .\n",
      "0, of her sweatshirt up over the elbows and down again. The soft hair on .\n",
      "0, her arms shone a lovely golden colour in the lights of the shop. \"I .\n",
      "0, didn't mean to say \"right’ exactly. I was looking for another way to put .\n",
      "0, it.\" .\n",
      "0, Elbows on the table, she stared at the calendar on the wall, almost as .\n",
      "219, though she were hoping to find the proper expression there. Failing, .\n",
      "0, she sighed and closed her eyes and played with her hairslide. .\n",
      "0, \"Never mind,\" I said. \"I think I know what you're getting at. I'm not .\n",
      "0, sure how to put it, either.\" .\n",
      "83, \"I can never say what I want to say,\" continued Naoko. \"It's been like .\n",
      "242, this for a while now. I try to say something, but all I get are the wrong .\n",
      "237, words - the wrong words or the exact opposite words from what I .\n",
      "345, mean. I try to correct myself, and that only makes it worse. I lose track .\n",
      "0, of what I was trying to say to begin with. It's like I'm split in two and .\n",
      "0, playing tag with myself. One half is chasing the other half around this .\n",
      "0, big, fat post. The other me has the right words, but this me can't catch .\n",
      "0, her.\" She raised her face and looked into my eyes. \"Does this make .\n",
      "0, any sense to you?\" .\n",
      "0, \"Everybody feels like that to some extent,\" I said. \"They're trying to .\n",
      "184, express themselves and it bothers t can't get it right.\" .\n",
      "237, Naoko looked disappointed with my answer. \"No, that’s not it either,\" .\n",
      "0, she said without further explanation .\n",
      "0, \"Anyway, I’d be glad to see you again,\" I said. \"I'm always free on .\n",
      "0, Sundays, and walking would be good for me.\" .\n",
      "0, We boarded the Yamanote Line, and Naoko transferred to the Chuo .\n",

      "0, suburb of Kokubunji. .\n",
      "0, \"Tell me,\" she said as we parted. \"Has anything changed about the .\n",

      "0, \"Sure. I'll be expecting to hear from you.\" .\n",
      "0, I first met Naoko when I was in the sixth-form at school. She was also .\n",
      "0, in the sixth-form at a posh girls' school run by one of the Christian .\n",
      "0, missions. The school was so refined you were considered unrefined if .\n",
      "0, you studied too much. Naoko was the girlfriend of my best (and only) .\n",
      "0, friend. Kizuki. The two of them had been close almost from birth, .\n",
      "0, their houses not 200 yards apart. .\n",
      "0, As with most couples who have been together since childhood, there .\n",
      "0, was a casual openness about the relationship of Kizuki and Naoko and .\n",
      "154, little sense that they wanted to be alone together. They were always .\n",
      "0, visiting each other's homes and eating or playing mah-jong with each .\n",
      "0, other's families. I double-dated with them any number of times. Naoko .\n",
      "0, would bring a school friend for me and the four of us would go to the .\n",
      "0, zoo or the pool or the cinema. The girls she brought were always .\n",
      "0, pretty, but a little too refined for my taste. I got along better with the .\n",

      "0, understand me, either. .\n",
      "0, After a while, Kizuki gave up trying to arrange dates for me, and .\n",
      "0, instead the three of us would do things together. Kizuki and Naoko .\n",
      "113, and I: odd, but that was the most comfortable combination. .\n",
      "0, Introducing a fourth person into the mix would always make things a .\n",
      "95, little awkward. We were like a TV talk show, with me the guest, .\n",
      "0, Kizuki the talented host, and Naoko his assistant. He was good at .\n",
      "0, 27 .\n",

      "167, stories: something strange, warped even. Each tale had its own .\n",

      "0, 48 .\n",

      "325, And yet, when I went inside her, Naoko tensed with pain. Was this her .\n",
      "0, first time? I asked, and she nodded. Now it was my turn to be .\n",
      "187, confused. I had assumed that Naoko had been sleeping with Kizuki all .\n",

      "0, When everything had ended, I asked Naoko why she had never slept .\n",
      "338, with Kizuki. This was a mistake. No sooner had I asked the question .\n",
      "220, than she took her arms from me and started crying soundlessly again. I .\n",
      "0, pulled her bedding from the closet, spread it on the mat floor, and put .\n",

      "0, awake or asleep, all words had left her lips, and her body now seemed .\n",
      "0, stiff, almost frozen. I tried several times to talk to her, but she would .\n",
      "0, not answer or move. I stared for a long time at her naked shoulder, but .\n",
      "134, in the end I lost all hope of eliciting a response and decided to get up. .\n",
      "0, The floor was still littered with record jackets, glasses, wine bottles .\n",

      "0, whom I could speak honestly of my feelings, and I imagined it had .\n",
      "0, been the same for Naoko. She and I had needed each other more than .\n",

      "0, the forest. Once, from far away, I heard what might have been a rifle .\n",
      "0, shot, but it was a small and muffled sound, as though it had passed .\n",
      "0, through several filters. .\n",
      "155, Beyond the woods I came to a white stone wall. It was no higher than .\n",
      "0, my own height and, lacking additional barriers on top, would have .\n",
      "0, been easy for me to scale. The black iron gate looked sturdy enough, .\n",
      "189, but it was wide open, and there was no one manning the guardhouse. .\n",
      "0, Another sign like the last one stood by the gate: AMI HOSTEL .\n",
      "0, 111 .\n",
      "268, PRIVATE NO TRESPASSING. A few clues suggested the guard had .\n",
      "0, been there until some moments before: the ashtray held three butt- .\n",
      "141, ends, a tea cup stood there half empty, a transistor radio sat on a shelf, .\n",
      "177, and the clock on the wall ticked off the time with a dry sound. I waited .\n",
      "177, a while for the person to come back, but when that showed no sign of .\n",
      "0, happening, I gave a few pushes to something that looked as if it might .\n",
      "0, be a bell. The area just inside the gate was a car park. In it stood a .\n",
      "0, mini-bus, a four-wheel drive Land Cruiser, and a dark blue Volvo. .\n",
      "0, The car park could have held 30 cars, but only those three were parked .\n",
      "0, there now. .\n",
      "0, Two or three minutes went by, and then a gatekeeper in a navy-blue .\n",
      "0, uniform came down the forest road on a yellow bicycle. He was a tall .\n",
      "0, man in his early sixties with receding hair. He leaned the yellow bike .\n",
      "126, against the guardhouse and said, \"I'm very sorry to have kept you .\n",
      "0, waiting,\" though he didn't sound sorry at all. The number 32 was .\n",
      "0, painted in white on the bike's mudguard. When I gave him my name, .\n",
      "0, he picked up the phone and repeated it twice to someone on the other .\n",
      "0, end, replied \"Yes, uh-huh, I see\" to the other person, then hung up. .\n",
      "0, \"Go to the main building, please, and ask for Doctor Ishida,\" he said .\n",
      "0, to me. \"You take this road through the trees to a roundabout. Then .\n",
      "0, take your second left - got that? Your second left - from the .\n",
      "0, roundabout. You'll see an old house. Turn right and go through .\n",
      "0, another bunch of trees to a concrete building. That's the main building. .\n",
      "0, It's easy, just watch for the signs.\" .\n",
      "0, I took the second left from the roundabout as instructed, and where .\n",
      "0, that path ended I came to an interesting old building that obviously .\n",
      "0, had been someone's country house once. It had a manicured garden .\n",
      "0, with well-shaped rocks and a stone lantern. It must have been a .\n",
      "0, country estate. Turning right through the trees, I saw a three-storey .\n",
      "0, concrete building. It stood in a hollowed-out area, and so there was .\n",
      "0, nothing overwhelming about its three storeys. It was simple in design .\n",
      "0, and gave a strong impression of cleanliness. .\n",
      "0, 112 .\n",
      "0, The entrance was on the second floor. I climbed the stairs and went in .\n",
      "0, through a big glass door to find a young woman in a red dress at the .\n",
      "0, reception desk. I gave her my name and said I had been instructed to .\n",
      "0, ask for Doctor Ishida. She smiled and gestured towards a brown sofa, .\n",
      "149, suggesting in low tones that I wait there for the doctor to come. Then .\n",
      "139, she dialled a number. I lowered my rucksack from my back, sank .\n",
      "0, down into the deep cushions of the sofa, and surveyed the place. It .\n",
      "0, was a clean, pleasant lobby, with ornamental potted plants, tasteful .\n",
      "0, abstract paintings, and a polished floor. As I waited, I kept my eyes on .\n",
      "0, the floor's reflection of my shoes. .\n",
      "0, At one point the receptionist assured me, \"The doctor will be here .\n",
      "217, soon.\" I nodded. What an incredibly quiet place! There were no .\n",
      "0, sounds of any kind. It was as though everyone were taking a siesta. .\n",
      "0, People, animals, insects, plants must all be sound asleep, I thought, it .\n",
      "0, was such a quiet afternoon. .\n",
      "0, Before long, though, I heard the soft padding of rubber soles, and a .\n",
      "0, mature, bristly-haired woman appeared. She swept across the lobby, .\n",
      "0, sat down next to me, crossed her legs and took my hand. Instead of .\n",
      "107, just shaking it, she turned my hand over, examining it front and back. .\n",
      "169, \"You haven't played a musical instrument, at least not for some years .\n",
      "0, now, have you?\" were the first words out of her mouth. .\n",
      "0, \"No,\" I said, taken aback. \"You’re right.\" .\n",
      "0, \"I can tell from your hands,\" she said with a smile. .\n",
      "0, There was something almost mysterious about this woman. Her face .\n",
      "0, had lots of wrinkles. These were the first thing to catch your eye, but .\n",
      "0, they didn’t make her look old. Instead, they emphasized a certain .\n",
      "0, youthfulness in her that transcended age. The wrinkles belonged .\n",
      "0, where they were, as if they had been part of her face since birth. When .\n",
      "0, she smiled, the wrinkles smiled with her; when she frowned, the .\n",
      "199, wrinkles frowned, too. And when she was neither smiling nor frown¬ .\n",
      "168, ing, the wrinkles lay scattered over her face in a strangely warm, .\n",
      "120, ironic way. Here was a woman in her late thirties who seemed not .\n",
      "0, 113 .\n",
      "0, merely a nice person but whose niceness drew you to her. I liked her .\n",
      "0, from the moment I saw her. .\n",
      "154, Wildly chopped, her hair stuck out in patches and the fringe lay .\n",
      "0, crooked against her forehead, but the style suited her perfectly. She .\n",
      "0, wore a blue work shirt over a white T-shirt, baggy, cream-coloured .\n",
      "148, cotton Uousers, and tennis shoes. Long and slim, she had almost no .\n",
      "130, breasts. Her lips moved constantly to one side in a kind of ironic curl, .\n",
      "0, and the wrinkles at the comers of her eyes moved in tiny twitches. She .\n",
      "0, looked like a kindly, skilled, but somewhat world-weary female .\n",
      "0, carpenter. .\n",
      "0, Chin drawn in and lips curled, she took some time to look me over .\n",
      "0, from head to toe. I imagined that any minute now she was going to .\n",
      "0, whip out her tape measure and start measuring me everywhere. .\n",
      "0, \"Can you play an instrument?\" she asked. \"Sorry, no,\" I said. .\n",
      "0, \"Too bad,\" she said. \"It would have been fun.\" .\n",
      "0, \"I suppose so,\" I said. Why all this talk about musical instruments? .\n",
      "0, She took a pack of Seven Stars from her breast pocket, put one .\n",
      "0, between her lips, lit it with a lighter and began puffing away with .\n",
      "0, obvious pleasure. .\n",
      "0, \"It crossed my mind that I should tell you about this place, Mr. - .\n",
      "0, Watanabe, wasn't it? - before you see Naoko. So I arranged for the .\n",
      "0, two of us to have this little talk. Ami Hostel is kind of unusual - you .\n",
      "167, might find it a little confusing without any background knowledge. .\n",
      "0, I'm right, aren't I, in supposing that you don't know anything about .\n",
      "0, this place?\" .\n",
      "0, \"Almost nothing.\" .\n",
      "0, \"Well, then, first of all - \" she began, then snapped her fingers. \"Come .\n",
      "0, to think of it, have you had lunch? I'll bet you're hungry.\" .\n",
      "0, \"You're right, I am.\" .\n",
      "0, \"Come with me, then. We can talk over food in the dining hall. .\n",
      "0, Lunchtime is over, but if we go now they can still make us .\n",
      "0, something.\" .\n",
      "0, 114 .\n",
      "0, She took the lead, hurrying down a corridor and a flight of stairs to the .\n",
      "0, first-floor dining hall. It was a large room, with enough space for .\n",
      "0, perhaps 200 people, but only half was in use, the other half partitioned .\n",
      "0, off, like a resort hotel out of season. The day's menu listed a potato .\n",
      "0, stew with noodles, salad, orange juice and bread. The vegetables .\n",
      "0, turned out to be as delicious as Naoko had said in her letter, and I .\n",
      "0, finished everything on my plate. .\n",
      "0, \"You obviously enjoy your food!\" said my female companion. .\n",
      "0, \"It's wonderful,\" I said. \"Plus, I've hardly eaten anything all day.\" .\n",
      "0, \"You're welcome to mine if you like. I'm full. Here, go ahead.\" .\n",
      "0, \"I will, if you really don’t want it.\" .\n",
      "0, \"I've got a small stomach. It doesn't hold much. I make up for what .\n",
      "167, I'm missing with cigarettes.\" She lit another Seven Star. \"Oh, by the .\n",
      "0, way, you can call me Reiko. Everybody does.\" .\n",
      "0, Reiko seemed to derive great pleasure from watching me while I ate .\n",
      "0, the potato stew she had hardly touched and munched on her bread. .\n",
      "0, \"Are you Naoko's doctor?\" I asked. .\n",
      "293, \"Me?! Naoko's doctor?!\" She screwed up her face. \"What makes you .\n",
      "0, think I'm a doctor?\" .\n",
      "0, \"They told me to ask for Doctor Ishida.\" .\n",
      "375, \"Oh, I get it. No no no, I teach music here. It's a kind of therapy for .\n",
      "0, some patients, so for fun they call me \"The Music Doctor' and .\n",
      "0, sometimes \"Doctor Ishida'. But I'm just another patient. I've been here .\n",
      "0, seven years. I work as a music teacher and help out in the office, so .\n",
      "104, it's hard to tell any more whether I'm a patient or staff. Didn’t Naoko .\n",
      "0, tell you about me?\" .\n",
      "412, I shook my head. .\n",
      "0, \"That's strange,\" said Reiko. \"I'm Naoko's room-mate. I like living .\n",
      "0, with her. We talk about all kinds of things. Including you.\" .\n",
      "0, \"What about me?\" .\n",
      "197, \"Well, first I have to tell you about this place,\" said Reiko, ignoring .\n",
      "0, 115 .\n",
      "145, my question. \"The first thing you ought to know is that this is no .\n",
      "0, ordinary \"hospital'. It's not so much for treatment as for .\n",
      "0, convalescence. We do have a few doctors, of course, and they give .\n",
      "0, hourly sessions, but they're just checking people's conditions, taking .\n",
      "0, their temperature and things like that, not administering \"treatments' .\n",
      "145, as in an ordinary hospital. There are no bars on the windows here, and .\n",
      "98, the gate is always wide open. People enter and leave voluntarily. You .\n",
      "0, have to be suited to that kind of convalescence to be admitted here in .\n",
      "0, the first place. In some cases, people who need specialized therapy .\n",
      "0, end up going to a specialized hospital. OK so far?\" .\n",
      "0, \"I think so,\" I said. \"But what does this \"convalescence' consist of? .\n",
      "0, Can you give me a concrete example?\" .\n",
      "0, Reiko exhaled a cloud of smoke and drank what was left of her orange .\n",
      "0, juice. \"Just living here is the convalescence,\" she said. A regular .\n",
      "201, routine, exercise, isolation from the outside world, clean air, quiet. .\n",
      "196, Our farmland makes us practically self-sufficient; there's no TV or .\n",
      "0, radio. We're like one of those commune places you hear so much .\n",
      "0, about. Of course, one thing different from a commune is that it costs a .\n",
      "0, bundle to get in here.\" .\n",
      "0, A bundle?\" .\n",
      "0, \"Well, it's not ridiculously expensive, but it's not cheap. Just look at .\n",
      "0, these facilities. We've got a lot of land here, a few patients, a big staff, .\n",
      "0, and in my case I've been here a long time. True, I'm almost staff .\n",
      "0, myself so I get concessions, but still ... Now, how about a cup of .\n",
      "0, coffee?\" .\n",
      "0, I said I’d like some. She stubbed out her cigarette and went over to the .\n",
      "0, counter, where she poured two cups of coffee from a warm pot and .\n",
      "0, brought them back to where we were sitting. She put sugar in hers, .\n",
      "0, stirred it, frowned, and took .\n",
      "0, a sip. .\n",
      "0, -You know,\" she said, \"this sanatorium is not a profitmaking .\n",
      "0, enterprise, so it can keep going without charging as much as it might .\n",
      "0, 116 .\n",
      "0, have to otherwise. The land was a donation. They created a .\n",
      "0, corporation for the purpose. The whole place used to be the donor's .\n",

      "0, I said I had. .\n",
      "0, \"That used to be the only building on the property. It’s where they did .\n",

      "257, tendency towards mental illness and a specialist recommended group .\n",
      "0, therapy for him. The doctor's theory was that if you could have a .\n",

      "0, physical labour and have a doctor for advice and check-ups, you could .\n",
      "0, cure certain kinds of sickness. They tried it, and the operation grew .\n",
      "0, and was incorporated, and they put more land under cultivation, and .\n",
      "0, put up the main building five years ago.\" .\n",
      "0, \"Meaning, the therapy worked.\" .\n",
      "134, \"Well, not for everything. Lots of people don't get better. But also a .\n",
      "0, lot of people who couldn't be helped anywhere else managed a .\n",
      "0, complete recovery here. The best thing about this place is the way .\n",
      "0, everybody helps everybody else. Everybody knows they're flawed in .\n",
      "0, some way, and so they try to help each other. Other places don't work .\n",
      "211, that way, unfortunately. Doctors are doctors and patients are patients: .\n",
      "0, the patient looks for help to the doctor and the doctor gives his help to .\n",
      "0, the patient. Here, though, we all help each other. We're all each other's .\n",
      "0, mirrors, and the doctors are part of us. They watch us from the .\n",
      "0, sidelines and they slip in to help us if they see we need something, but .\n",
      "0, it sometimes happens that we help them. Sometimes we're better at .\n",
      "0, something than they are. For example, I'm teaching one doctor to play .\n",
      "0, the piano and another patient is teaching a nurse French. That kind of .\n",
      "144, thing. Patients with problems like ours are often blessed with special .\n",
      "0, abilities. So everyone here is equal - patients, staff - and you. You're .\n",
      "0, one of us while you're in here, so I help you and you help me.\" Reiko .\n",
      "0, smiled, gently flexing every wrinkle on her face. \"You help Naoko .\n",
      "0, and Naoko helps you.\" .\n",

      "0, \"What should I do, then? Give me an example.\" .\n",
      "0, \"First you decide that you want to help and that you need to be helped .\n",
      "0, by the other person. Then you are totally honest. You will not lie, you .\n",

      "224, prove embarrassing to you. That's all there is to it.\" .\n",
      "0, \"I'll try,\" I said. \"But tell me, Reiko, why have you been in here for .\n",

      "0, \"Not while the sun's up,\" she said with a sombre look. \"But when .\n",
      "0, night comes, I start drooling and rolling on the floor.\" \"Really?\" .\n",
      "133, \"Don't be ridiculous. I'm kidding,\" she said, shaking her head with a .\n",
      "239, look of disgust. \"I'm completely well - for now, at least. I stay here .\n",
      "0, because I enjoy helping other people get well, teaching music, .\n",
      "0, growing vegetables. I like it here. We're all more or less friends. .\n",
      "0, Compared to that, what have I got in the outside world? I'm 38, going .\n",
      "140, on 40. I'm not like Naoko. There's nobody waiting for me to get out, .\n",
      "145, no family to take me back. I don’t have any work to speak of, and .\n",
      "129, almost no friends. And after seven years, I don't know what's going on .\n",
      "0, out there. Oh, I'll read a paper in the library every once in a while, but .\n",
      "0, I haven't set foot outside this property all that time. I wouldn’t know .\n",

      "0, \"But maybe a new world would open up for you,\" I said. \"It’s worth a .\n",

      "190, and over in her hand. \"But I’ve got my own set of problems. lean tell .\n",
      "0, you all about them sometime if you like.\" .\n",
      "0, I nodded in response. \"And Naoko,\" I said, \"is she any better?\" .\n",
      "129, \"Hmm, we think so. She was pretty confused at first and we had our .\n",
      "88, doubts for a while, but she’s calmed down now and improved to the .\n",

      "0, \"They weren't?\" I shot back. .\n",
      "0, \"You didn’t know?\" Reiko seemed more surprised than I was. .\n",
      "412, I shook my head. .\n",
      "0, \"I’d better let Naoko tell you about that herself. She's ready for some .\n",

      "0, Maybe, once you've got that taken care of, you can go back and think .\n",

      "0, face to my neck. She stayed like that for a time, almost as if she were .\n",

      "0, 125 .\n",
      "0, With Naoko gone, I went to sleep on the sofa. I hadn't intended to do .\n",
      "0, so, but I fell into the kind of deep sleep I had not had for a long time, .\n",

      "0, in people's ages, the scene looked pretty much like that of the dining .\n",

      "155, saying, but the way they said it reminded me of the strange tennis .\n",

      "0, doctor. .\n",
      "0, \"What do you people talk about?\" I asked Reiko, who seemed to not .\n",
      "0, quite follow me. .\n",

      "0, recent months, but sitting here eating fish in this unnaturally quiet .\n",

      "0, that, I said, and after they were gone I undressed, showered, and .\n",
      "0, washed my hair. I found a Bill Evans album in the bookcase and was .\n",

      "167, night she cried and I took her in my arms. That had been only six .\n",
      "0, months ago, but it felt like something from a much remoter past. .\n",
      "0, Maybe it felt that way because I had thought about it so often - too .\n",

      "0, so much in the course of half a year. I felt as drawn to her as ever, .\n",
      "185, perhaps more than before, but the thought of what she had lost in the .\n",

      "0, and his uncentred morality, but Naoko seemed finally to grasp what I .\n",

      "0, him, revealing only that the one person in the dorm I spent any real .\n",

      "0, occasional breaks for wine and cigarettes. .\n",
      "146, \"He sounds like a strange person,\" said Naoko. \"He is strange,\" I .\n",
      "0, said. \"But you like him?\" .\n",
      "161, \"I'm not sure,\" I said. \"I guess I can't say I like him. Nagasawa is .\n",

      "0, \"It's probably up to 80 now,\" I said. \"But in his case, the higher the .\n",

      "0, what I think he's trying to accomplish.\" .\n",
      "0, \"And you call that \"stoic'?\" .\n",
      "0, \"For him it is.\" .\n",
      "0, Naoko thought about my words for a minute. \"I think he's a lot sicker .\n",

      "0, \"So do I,\" I said. \"But he can put all of his warped qualities into a .\n",

      "0, 134 .\n",
      "161, Naoko remained silent for a long time, staring at her toes. At a loss for .\n",
      "0, words, I took another sip of wine. .\n",
      "0, \"How many girls have you slept with, Toru?\" Naoko asked in a tiny .\n",
      "0, voice as if the thought had just crossed her mind. .\n",

      "0, Reiko plopped the guitar into her lap. \"You're not even 20 years old!\" .\n",
      "0, she said. \"What kind of life are you leading?\" .\n",
      "0, Naoko kept silent and watched me with those clear eyes of hers. I told .\n",
      "193, Reiko about the first girl I'd slept with and how we had broken up. I .\n",
      "0, had found it impossible to love her, I explained. I went on to tell her .\n",

      "0, \"I couldn’t get wet,\" she said in a tiny voice. \"I never opened to him. .\n",

      "0, \"Sure,\" I said. The rabbit hutch was behind the aviary. Some ten .\n",
      "0, rabbits lay inside, asleep in the straw. Naoko swept up their droppings, .\n",
      "0, put feed in their box, and picked up one of the babies, nibbing it .\n",
      "0, against her cheek. .\n",
      "0, \"Isn't it precious?\" she gushed. She let me hold it. The warm, little ball .\n",

      "0, \"It's complicated.\" .\n",
      "0, Hatsumi sighed. .\n",
      "0, At that point the door opened and the food was carried in. Nagasawa .\n",
      "0, was presented with his roast duck, and Hatsumi and I received our sea .\n",
      "0, bass. The waiters heaped freshcooked vegetables on our plates and .\n",
      "0, dribbled sauce on them before withdrawing and leaving the three of us .\n",
      "291, alone again. Nagasawa cut a slice of duck and ate it with gusto, .\n",
      "0, followed by more whisky. I took a forkful of spinach. Hatsumi didn’t .\n",
      "0, touch her food. .\n",
      "0, 247 .\n",
      "167, \"You know, Tom,\" she said. \"I have no idea what makes your .\n",
      "0, situation so \"complicated', but I do think that the kind of thing you just .\n",
      "0, told me about is not right for you. You're not that kind of person. .\n",
      "0, What do you think?\" She placed her hands on the table and looked me .\n",
      "0, in the eye. .\n",
      "0, \"Well,\" I said, \"I've felt that way myself sometimes.\" .\n",
      "0, \"So why don't you stop?\" .\n",
      "0, \"Because sometimes I have a need for human warmth,\" I answered .\n",
      "140, honestly. \"Sometimes, if I can't feel something like the warmth of a .\n",
      "316, woman's skin, I get so lonely I can't stand it.\" .\n",
      "0, \"Here, let me summarize what I think it's all about,\" interjected .\n",
      "0, Nagasawa. \"Watanabe's got this girl he likes, but for certain .\n",
      "0, complicated reasons, they can't do it. So he tells himself \"Sex is just .\n",
      "179, sex', and he takes care of his need with somebody else. What's wrong .\n",
      "0, with that? It makes perfect sense. He can't just stay locked in his room .\n",
      "0, tossing off all the time, can he?\" .\n",
      "0, \"But if you really love her, Tom, shouldn’t it be possible for you to .\n",
      "0, control yourself ?\" .\n",
      "0, \"Maybe so,\" I said, bringing a piece of sea bass in cream sauce to my .\n",
      "0, mouth. .\n",
      "0, \"You just don't understand a man's sexual needs,\" said Nagasawa to .\n",
      "0, Hatsumi. \"Look at me, for example. I've been with you for three years, .\n",
      "0, and I've slept with plenty of women in that time. But I don't remember .\n",
      "0, a thing about them. I don't know their names, I don't remember their .\n",
      "0, faces. I slept with each of them exactly once. Meet 'em, do it, so long. .\n",
      "383, That's it. What's wrong with that?\" .\n",
      "236, \"What I can't stand is that arrogance of yours,\" said Hatsumi in a soft .\n",
      "0, voice. \"Whether you sleep with other women or not is beside the .\n",
      "0, point. I've never really been angry with you for sleeping around, have .\n",
      "0, I?\" .\n",
      "0, \"You can't even call what I do sleeping around. It's just a game. .\n",
      "0, 248 .\n",
      "0, Nobody gets hurt,\" said Nagasawa. .\n",
      "0, \"I get hurt,\" said Hatsumi. \"Why am I not enough for you?\" .\n",
      "0, Nagasawa kept silent for a moment and swirled the whisky in his .\n",
      "0, glass. \"It's not that you're not enough for me. That's another phase, .\n",
      "351, another question. It's just a hunger I have inside me. If I've hurt you. .\n",
      "87, I'm sorry. But it's not a question of whether or not you're enough for .\n",
      "143, me. I can only live with that hunger. That's the kind of man I am. .\n",
      "0, That's what makes me me. There's nothing I can do about it, don't you .\n",
      "0, see?\" .\n",
      "0, At last Hatsumi picked up her silverware and started eating her fish. .\n",
      "358, \"At least you shouldn’t drag Torn into your \"games'.\" .\n",
      "0, \"We're a lot alike, though, Watanabe and me,\" said Nagasawa. .\n",
      "0, \"Neither of us is interested, essentially, in anything but ourselves. OK. .\n",
      "138, so I'm arrogant and he's not, but neither of us is able to feel any .\n",
      "0, interest in anything other than what we ourselves think or feel or do. .\n",
      "0, That's why we can think about things in a way that's totally divorced .\n",
      "0, from anybody else. That's what I like about him. The only difference .\n",
      "182, is that he hasn't realized this about himself, and so he hesitates and .\n",
      "0, feels hurt.\" .\n",
      "0, \"What human being doesn't hesitate and feel hurt?\" Hatsumi .\n",
      "147, demanded. \"Are you trying to say that you have never felt those .\n",
      "0, things?\" .\n",
      "0, \"Of course I have, but I've disciplined myself to where I can minimize .\n",
      "162, them. Even a rat will choose the least painful route if you shock him .\n",
      "0, enough.\" .\n",
      "0, \"But rats don't fall in love.\" .\n",
      "0, \"\"Rats don't fall in love'.\" Nagasawa looked at me. \"That's great. We .\n",
      "0, should have background music for this - a full orchestra with two .\n",
      "0, harps and -\" .\n",
      "311, \"Don't make fun of me. I'm serious.\" .\n",
      "0, -We're eating,\" said Nagasawa. \"And Watanabe's here. It .night be .\n",
      "0, more civil for us to confine 'serious' talk to another occasion.\" .\n",
      "0, 249 .\n",
      "0, \"I can leave,\" I said. .\n",
      "0, \"No,\" said Hatsumi. \"Please stay. It's better with you here.\" .\n",
      "0, \"At least have dessert,\" said Nagasawa. .\n",
      "0, \"I don’t mind, really.\" .\n",
      "0, The three of us went on eating in silence for a time. I finished my fish. .\n",
      "0, Hatsumi left half of hers. Nagasawa had polished off his duck long .\n",
      "0, before and was now concentrating on his whisky. .\n",
      "163, \"That was excellent sea bass,\" I offered, but no one took me up on it. I .\n",
      "0, might as well have thrown a rock down a deep well. .\n",
      "0, The waiters took away our plates and brought lemon sherbet and .\n",
      "0, espresso. Nagasawa barely touched his dessert and coffee, moving .\n",
      "223, directly to a cigarette. Hatsumi ignored her sherbet. \"Oh boy,\" I .\n",
      "0, thought to myself as I finished my sherbet and coffee. Hatsumi stared .\n",
      "0, at her hands on the table. Like everything she wore, her hands looked .\n",
      "0, chic and elegant and expensive. I thought about Naoko and Reiko. .\n",
      "236, What would they be doing now? I wondered. Naoko could be lying on .\n",
      "0, the sofa reading a book, and Reiko might be playing \"Norwegian .\n",
      "0, Wood\" on her guitar. I felt an intense desire to go back to that little .\n",
      "315, room of theirs. What the hell was I doing in this place? .\n",
      "0, \"Where Watanabe and I are alike is, we don't give a shit if nobody .\n",
      "0, understands us,\" Nagasawa said. \"That's what makes us different from .\n",
      "196, everybody else. They're all worried about whether the people around .\n",
      "0, them understand them. But not me, and not Watanabe. We just don't .\n",
      "375, give a shit. Self and others are separate.\" .\n",
      "0, \"Is this true?\" Hatsumi asked me. .\n",
      "339, \"No,\" I said. \"I'm not that strong. I don't feel it's OK if nobody .\n",
      "0, understands me. I've got people I want to understand and be .\n",
      "0, understood by. But aside from those few, well, I feel it's kind of .\n",
      "334, hopeless. I don't agree with Nagasawa. I do care if people understand .\n",
      "0, me.\" .\n",
      "0, \"That's practically the same thing as what I'm saying,\" said Nagasawa, .\n",
      "0, picking up his coffee spoon. \"It is the same! It's the difference .\n",
      "0, 250 .\n",
      "0, between a late breakfast or an early lunch. Same time, same food, .\n",
      "0, different name.\" .\n",
      "247, Now Hatsumi spoke to Nagasawa. \"Don't you care whether I .\n",
      "0, understand you or not?\" .\n",
      "0, \"You don’t get it, do you? Person A understands Person B because the .\n",
      "0, time is right for that to happen, not because Person B wants to be .\n",
      "0, understood by Person A.\" .\n",
      "167, \"So is it a mistake for me to feel that I want to be understood by .\n",
      "0, someone - by you, for example?\" .\n",
      "0, \"No, it’s not a mistake,\" answered Nagasawa. \"Most people would call .\n",
      "0, that love, if you think you want to understand me. My system for .\n",
      "0, living is way different from other people's systems for living.\" .\n",
      "206, \"So what you're saying is you're not in love with me, is that it?\" .\n",
      "0, \"Well, my system and your -\" .\n",
      "379, \"To hell with your fucking system!\" Hatsumi shouted. That .\n",
      "0, was the first and last time I ever heard her shout. .\n",
      "0, Nagasawa pushed the button by the table, and the waiter .\n",
      "0, came in with the bill. Nagasawa handed him a credit card. \"Sony .\n",
      "0, about this, Watanabe,\" said Nagasawa. \"I'm going .\n",
      "143, to see Hatsumi home. You go back to the donn alone, OK?\" \"You .\n",
      "98, don't have to apologize to me. Great meal,\" I said, but .\n",
      "306, no one said anything in response. .\n",
      "0, The waiter brought the card, and Nagasawa signed with a ballpoint .\n",
      "0, pen after checking the amount. Then the three of us stood and went .\n",
      "0, outside. Nagasawa started to step into the street to hail a taxi, but .\n",
      "487, Hatsumi stopped him. .\n",
      "100, \"Thanks, but I don't want to spend any more time with you today. You .\n",
      "0, don’t have to see me home. Thank you for dinner.\" .\n",
      "0, ..Whatever,\" said Nagasawa. .\n",
      "0, \"I want Tom to see me home.\" .\n",
      "0, \"Whatever,\" said Nagasawa. \"But Watanabe's practically the same as .\n",
      "197, me. He may be a nice guy, but deep down in his heart he's incapable .\n",
      "0, 251 .\n",
      "0, of loving anybody. There's always some part of him somewhere that's .\n",
      "241, wide awake and detached. He just has that hunger that won't go away. .\n",
      "0, Believe me, I know what I'm talking about.\" .\n",
      "0, I flagged down a taxi and let Hatsumi in first. \"Anyway,\" I said to .\n",
      "0, Nagasawa, \"I'll make sure she gets home.\" .\n",
      "87, \"Sorry to put you through this,\" said Nagasawa, but I could see that he .\n",
      "0, was already thinking about something else. .\n",
      "0, Once inside the cab, I asked Hatsumi, \"Where do you want to go? .\n",
      "0, Back to Ebisu?\" Her flat was in Ebisu. .\n",
      "318, She shook her head. .\n",
      "0, \"OK. How about a drink somewhere?\" .\n",
      "0, \"Yes,\" she said with a nod. .\n",
      "0, \"Shibuya,\" I told the driver. .\n",
      "0, Folding her arms and closing her eyes, Hatsumi sank back into the .\n",
      "0, comer of the seat. Her small gold earrings caught the light as the taxi .\n",
      "0, swayed. Her midnight-blue dress seemed to have been made to match .\n",
      "154, the darkness of the interior. Every now and then her lightly made-up, .\n",
      "0, beautifully formed lips would quiver slightly as though she had caught .\n",
      "0, herself on the verge of talking to herself. Watching her, I could see .\n",
      "0, why Nagasawa had chosen her as his special companion. There were .\n",
      "0, any number of women more beautiful than Hatsumi, and Nagasawa .\n",
      "0, could have made any of them his. But Hatsumi had some quality that .\n",
      "0, could send a tremor through your heart. It was nothing forceful. The .\n",
      "0, power she exerted was a subtle thing, but it called forth deep .\n",
      "0, resonances. I watched her all the way to Shibuya, and wondered, .\n",
      "0, without ever finding an answer, what this emotional reverberation .\n",
      "0, could be that I was feeling. .\n",
      "0, It finally hit me some dozen or so years later. I had gone to Santa Fe .\n",
      "0, to interview a painter and was sitting in a local pizza parlour, drinking .\n",
      "0, beer and eating pizza and watching a miraculously beautiful sunset. .\n",
      "0, Everything was soaked in brilliant red - my hand, the plate, the table. .\n",
      "0, 252 .\n",
      "0, the world - as if some special kind of fruit juice had splashed down on .\n",
      "0, everything. In the midst of this overwhelming sunset, the image of .\n",
      "0, Hatsumi flashed into my mind, and in that moment I understood what .\n",
      "84, that tremor of the heart had been. It was a kind of childhood longing .\n",
      "237, that had always remained - and would for ever remain - unfulfilled. I .\n",
      "152, had forgotten the existence of such innocent, almost burnt-in longing: .\n",
      "147, forgotten for years that such feelings had ever existed inside me. What .\n",
      "0, Hatsumi had stirred in me was a part of my very self that had long lain .\n",
      "375, dormant. And when the realization struck me, it aroused such sorrow I .\n",
      "120, almost burst into tears. She had been an absolutely special woman. .\n",
      "0, Someone should have done something - anything - to save her. .\n",
      "0, But neither Nagasawa nor I could have managed that. As so many of .\n",
      "0, those I knew had done, Hatsumi reached a certain stage in life and .\n",
      "0, decided - almost on the spur of the moment - to end it. Two years after .\n",
      "0, Nagasawa left for Germany, she married, and two years after that she .\n",
      "275, slashed her wrists with a razor blade. .\n",
      "0, It was Nagasawa, of course, who told me what had .\n",
      "302, happened. His letter from Bonn said this: \"Hatsumi's death has .\n",
      "429, extinguished something. This is unbearably sad and painful, even to .\n",
      "0, me.\" I ripped his letter to shreds and threw it away. I never wrote to .\n",
      "0, him again. .\n",
      "0, Hatsumi and I went to a small bar and downed several drinks. Neither .\n",
      "144, of us said much. Like a bored, old married couple, we sat opposite .\n",
      "0, each other, drinking in silence and munching peanuts. When the place .\n",
      "97, began to fill up, we went for a walk. Hatsumi said she would pay the .\n",
      "0, bill, but I insisted on paying because the drinks had been my idea. .\n",
      "0, There was a deep chill in the night air. Hatsumi wrapped herself in her .\n",
      "164, pale grey cardigan and walked by my side in silence. I had no .\n",
      "0, destination in mind as we ambled through the nighttime streets, my .\n",
      "0, hands shoved deep into my pockets. This was just like walking with .\n",
      "0, Naoko, it occurred to me. .\n",
      "0, 253 .\n",
      "0, \"Do you know somewhere we could play pool around here?\" Hatsumi .\n",
      "0, asked me without warning. .\n",
      "0, \"Pool? You play?\" .\n",
      "0, \"Yeah, I'm pretty good. How about you?\" .\n",
      "0, \"I play a little. Not that I'm very good at it.\" .\n",
      "0, \"OK. then. Let's go.\" .\n",
      "0, We found a pool hall nearby and went in. It was a small place at the .\n",
      "0, far end of an alley. The two of us - Hatsumi in her chic dress and I in .\n",
      "0, my blue blazer and regimental tie - clashed with the scruffy pool hall, .\n",
      "0, but this didn't seem to concern Hatsumi at all as she chose and chalked .\n",
      "0, her cue. She pulled a hairslide from her bag and clipped her hair aside .\n",
      "0, at one temple to keep it from interfering with her game. .\n",
      "0, We played two games. Hatsumi was as good as she had claimed to be, .\n",
      "0, while my own game was hampered by the thick bandage I still wore .\n",
      "204, on my cut hand. She crashed me. .\n",
      "0, \"You’re great,\" I said in admiration. .\n",
      "0, \"You mean appearances can be deceiving?\" she asked as she sized up .\n",
      "0, a shot, smiling. .\n",
      "0, \"Where did you learn to play like that?\" .\n",
      "0, \"My grandfather - my father's father - was an old playboy. He had a .\n",

      "0, when I got a little bigger my grandfather taught me the right moves. .\n",
      "236, He was a wonderful guy - stylish, handsome. He's dead now, though. .\n",

      "0, York.\" .\n",
      "155, She got three in a row, then missed on the fourth try. I managed to .\n",
      "198, squeeze out a point, then missed an easy shot. .\n",
      "0, \"It's the bandage,\" said Hatsumi to comfort me. .\n",
      "156, \"No, it's because I haven't played for so long,\" I said. \"Two years and .\n",

      "0, 254 .\n",
      "228, \"My friend died the night after our last game together,\" I said. .\n",
      "421, \"So you stopped playing?\" .\n",
      "0, \"No, not really,\" I said after giving it some thought. \"I just never had .\n",
      "0, the opportunity to play after that. That's all.\" \"How did your friend .\n",
      "0, die?\" .\n",
      "0, \"Traffic accident.\" .\n",
      "118, She made several more shots, aiming with deadly seriousness and .\n",
      "0, adjusting the strength of each shot with precision. Watching her in .\n",
      "0, action - her carefully set hair swept back out of her eyes, golden .\n",
      "0, earrings sparkling, court shoes set firmly on the floor, lovely, slender .\n",
      "0, fingers pressing the green baize as she took her shot - I felt as if her .\n",
      "0, side of the scruffy pool hall had been transformed into part of some .\n",
      "132, elegant social event. I had never spent time with her alone before, and .\n",
      "0, this was a marvellous experience for me, as though I had been drawn .\n",
      "0, up to a higher plane of life. At the end of the third game - in which, of .\n",
      "308, course, she crushed me again -my cut began to throb, and so we .\n",
      "514, stopped playing. .\n",
      "0, \"I'm sorry,\" she said with what seemed like genuine concern. \"I should .\n",
      "0, never have suggested this.\" .\n",
      "178, \"That's OK,\" I said. \"It's not a bad cut, I enjoyed playing. Really.\" .\n",
      "0, As we were leaving the pool hall, the skinny woman owner said to .\n",
      "0, Hatsumi, \"You've a good eye, sister.\" Hatsumi gave her a sweet smile .\n",
      "0, and thanked her as she paid the bill. .\n",
      "0, \"Does it hurt?\" she asked when we were outside. .\n",
      "0, \"Not much,\" I said. .\n",
      "0, \"Do you think it opened?\" .\n",

      "121, \"Or is it that you don't like being with me? You want to go back to .\n",

      "0, \"All right, then. Don’t stand on ceremony. It's a short walk.\" .\n",
      "0, Hatsumi's flat was a 15-minute walk from Shibuya towards Ebisu. By .\n",
      "135, no means a glamorous building, it was more than decent, with a nice .\n",

      "0, to understand what she's been going through. Her condition is not .\n",
      "0, good, I have to say in all honesty. She was trying her best to stand on .\n",

      "197, Looking back, I see now that the first symptom of her problem was .\n",
      "139, her loss of the ability to write letters. That happened around the end of .\n",

      "0, Whenever she would try to write a letter, she would hear people .\n",
      "0, talking to her, which made it impossible for her to write. The voices .\n",
      "0, would interfere with her attempts to choose her words. It wasn't all .\n",
      "200, that bad until about the time of your second visit, so I didn't take it too .\n",
      "124, seriously. For all of us here, these kinds of symptoms come in cycles, .\n",
      "102, more or less. In her case, they got quite serious after you left. She is .\n",
      "231, having trouble now just holding an ordinary conversation. She can't .\n",
      "349, find the right words to speak, and that puts her into a terribly confused .\n",

      "0, We have a session every day with one of the specialists. Naoko and .\n",

      "0, 293 .\n",
      "0, you to one of our sessions if possible, and the doctor was in favour of .\n",

      "0, was: \"I want my body to be clean of all this when I meet him.\" That .\n",
      "0, was not the problem, I said to her; the problem was to get her well as .\n",
      "98, quickly as possible, and I pushed as hard as I could, but she wouldn’t .\n",
      "0, change her mind. .\n",
      "0, I think I once explained to you that this is not a specialized hospital. .\n",
      "0, We do have medical specialists here, of course, and they provide .\n",
      "0, effective treatments, but concentrated therapy is another matter. The .\n",
      "0, point of this place is to create an effective environment in which the .\n",
      "0, patient can treat herself or himself, and that does not, properly .\n",
      "0, speaking, include medical treatment. Which means that if Naoko's .\n",
      "220, condition grows any worse, they will probably have to transfer her to .\n",
      "0, some other hospital or medical facility or what have you. Personally, I .\n",
      "130, would find this very painful, but we would have to do it. That isn’t to .\n",
      "0, say that she couldn’t come back here for treatment on a kind of .\n",
      "85, temporary \"leave of absence\". Or, better yet, she could even be cured .\n",
      "0, and finish with hospitals completely. In any case, we're doing .\n",
      "0, everything we can, and Naoko is doing everything she can. The best .\n",
      "0, thing you can do meanwhile is hope for her recovery and keep sending .\n",
      "0, her those letters. .\n",
      "0, It was dated 31 March. After I had read it, I stayed on the porch and .\n",
      "0, let my eyes wander out to the garden, full now with the freshness of .\n",

      "0, \"It's Naoko's,\" said Reiko. \"I bet you didn’t know we were the same .\n",

      "0, Now that she mentioned it, I saw that Reiko's build was almost .\n",
      "0, identical to Naoko's. Because of the shape of her face and her thin .\n",
      "0, arms and legs, she had always given me the impression of being .\n",

      "0, she’d be fine, so they called a taxi and the mother left. We weren't .\n",

      "172, fact, until then I had been very worried. I had been expecting her to be .\n",
      "379, depressed and worn out and emaciated. I mean, I knew how much the .\n",
      "0, testing and therapy and stuff they do at those hospitals can take it out .\n",
      "103, of you, so I had some real doubts about this visit. But one look at her .\n",
      "0, was all it took to convince me she'd be OK. She looked a lot healthier .\n",
      "0, than I had expected and she was smiling and joking and talking much .\n",
      "0, more normally than when I had seen her last. She had been to the .\n",
      "0, hairdresser's and was showing off her new hairdo. So I thought there .\n",
      "130, would be nothing to worry about even if her mother left us alone. .\n",
      "0, Naoko told me that this time she was going to let those hospital .\n",
      "0, doctors cure her once and for all, and I said that that would probably .\n",
      "0, be the best thing to do. So then the two of us went out for a walk, .\n",
      "0, talking all the time, mainly about the future. Naoko told me that what .\n",
      "0, she’d really like was for the two of us to get out of the sanatorium and .\n",
      "0, live together somewhere.\" .\n",
      "0, \"Live together? You and Naoko?\" .\n",
      "0, \"That's right,\" said Reiko with a little shrug. \"So I told her it sounded .\n",
      "0, good to me, but what about Watanabe? And she said, \"Don't worry. .\n",
      "0, I'll get everything straight with him.' That's all. Then she talked about .\n",
      "0, where she and I would live and what we'd do, that kind of thing. After .\n",
      "0, that we went to the aviary and played with the birds.\" .\n",
      "0, I took a beer from the fridge and opened it. Reiko lit another cigarette, .\n",

      "0, been such a load off her mind to feel she knew exactly what she was .\n",
      "0, going to do. So then we finished going through her stuff and throwing .\n",
      "0, what she didn't need into the metal drum in the garden and burning it: .\n",
      "0, the notebook she had used as a diary, and all the letters she had .\n",
      "141, received. Your letters, too. This seemed a bit strange to me, so I asked .\n",
      "0, 337 .\n",
      "0, her why she was burning stuff like that. I mean, she had always been .\n",
      "0, so careful about putting your letters away in a safe place and reading .\n",
      "0, them over and over. She said, \"I'm getting rid of everything from the .\n",
      "0, past so I can be reborn in the future.' I suppose I pretty much took her .\n",
      "0, at her word. It had its own kind of logic to it, sort of. I remember .\n",
      "0, thinking how much I wanted her to get healthy and happy. She was so .\n",
      "0, sweet and lovely that day: I wish you could have seen her! .\n",
      "0, \"When that was over, we went to the dining hall for supper the way .\n",
      "0, we used to. Then we bathed and I opened a bottle of good wine that I .\n",
      "0, had been keeping for a special occasion like this and we drank and I .\n",
      "0, played the guitar. The Beatles, as always, \"Norwegian Wood\", .\n",

      "0, turned out the lights, got undressed and lay in our beds. It was one of .\n",

      "0, started talking about you - about the night she had sex with you. In .\n",
      "0, incredible detail. How you took her clothes off, how you touched her, .\n",
      "0, how she found herself getting wet, how you went inside her, how .\n",
      "0, wonderful it felt: she told me all of this in vivid detail. So I asked her: .\n",
      "0, why are you telling me this now, all of a sudden? I mean, up to then, .\n",
      "0, she had never spoken openly to me about sex. Of course, we had had .\n",
      "0, some frank sexual talk as a kind of therapy, but she had been too .\n",
      "327, embarrassed to go into details. Now I couldn't stop her. I was shocked. .\n",

      "0, He put it in as far as he could. I thought, but then he lifted my legs and .\n",
